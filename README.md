# TaxGPT for all your Australian Tax questions

## Overview

This repo builds an LLM Chatbot that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation to answer questions about Australian Tax. LlamaIndex is used to chunk web text and build index, and then provide this context along with the prompt to the GPT-4 model to build the chatbot.

## Disclaimer
No proprietary tarinig data was used for this Chatbot and I hold no responsibility for the chatbot's answer's correctness.

THE OPENING   (al-Fatihah)  \n1. THE OPENING  \n(al-Fatihah ) \n \n1. In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Mer-\nciful.  \n2. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.  \n3. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  \n4. Master of the Day of Judgment.  \n5. It is You we worship, and upon You we call \nfor help.  \n6. Guide us to the straight path.  \n7. The path of those You have blessed, not of \nthose against whom there is anger, nor of \nthose who are misguided.  \n \n2. THE HEIFER  \n(al-Baqarah ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  \n2. This is the Book in which there is no doubt, \na guide for the righteous.  \n3. Those who believe in the unseen, and pe r-\nform the prayers, and give from what We \nhave provided for them.  \n4. And those who believe in what was revealed \nto you, and in what was revealed before you, \nand are certain of the Hereafter.  \n5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. \nThese are the successf ul. \n6. As for those who disbelieve \u2014it is the same \nfor them, whether you have warned them, or have not warned them \u2014they do not believe.  \n7. Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on \ntheir hearing, and over their vision is a veil. \nThey will have a severe to rment.  \n8. Among the people are those who say, \u201cWe \nbelieve in Allah and in the Last Day,\u201d but they \nare not believers.  9. They seek to deceive Allah and those who \nbelieve, but they deceive none but them-\nselves, though they are not aware.  \n10. In their hearts i s sickness, and Allah has in-\ncreased their sickness. They will have a pain-\nful punishment because of their denial.  \n11. And when it is said to them, \u201cDo not make \ntrouble on earth,\u201d they say, \u201cWe are only re-\nformers.\u201d  \n12. In fact, they are the troublemakers, bu t they \nare not aware.  \n13. And when it is said to them, \u201cBelieve as the \npeople have believed,\u201d they say, \u201cShall we be-\nlieve as the fools have believed?\u201d In fact, it is \nthey who are the fools, but they do not know.  \n14. And when they come across those who be-\nlieve, they say, \u201cWe believe\u201d; but when they \nare alone with their devils, they say, \u201cWe are with you; we were only ridiculing.\u201d  \n15. It is Allah who ridicules them, and leaves \nthem bewildered in their transgression.  \n16. Those are they who have bartered error for \nguidance; but their trade does not profit them, and they are not guided.  \n17. Their likeness is that of a person who kin-\ndled a fire; when it illuminated all around \nhim, Allah took away their light, and left \nthem in darkness, unable to see.  \n18. Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return.  \n19. Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which \nis darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They \npress their fingers into their ears from the thunderbolts, in fear of death. But Allah sur-\nrounds the disbelievers.  \n20. The lightning almost snatches their sight \naway. Whenever it illuminates for them, they \nwalk in it; but when it grows dark over them, \nthey stand still. Had Allah willed, He could \nhave taken away their hearing and their sight. \nAllah is capable of everything.  \n21. O people! Worship your Lord who created \nyou and those before you, that you may attain piety.  \n1", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3168, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6cb2ac1-db64-4ce9-8fc4-d5c4a86473d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6cb2ac1-db64-4ce9-8fc4-d5c4a86473d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0648f82-abdb-4109-a9a1-2a0c3e4aeb41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "4d5cd57218aa9f2a244766f8a6334eb3f7004423733c6d97ab8efde6d3739e19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "592ee6c4-c8b2-4257-a473-14b8fe7aeb87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "51ba98c7b7171a248b9ae19bbbdbf60fc025b4a1f5cfe17b9ac27aafc13dbf82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bbddd495-bf22-430b-ac4c-f2d828df7c9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36791c5494e2685fe8cdc2521fd05e5b38f737eb633b01ed7b0d7475789ba09c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "eedf2a52199b2218c464e6868b2bd0f252ac65e4dc9c3182ef9c73611b238529", "text": "2.

T herefore, \ndo not assign rivals to Allah while you know.  \n23. And if you are in doubt about what We \nhave revealed to Our servant, then produce a \nchapter like these, and call your witnesses \napart from Allah, if you are truthful.  \n24. But if you do not\u2014 and you will not \u2014then \nbeware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.  \n25. And give good news to those who believe \nand do righteous deeds; that they will have \ngardens beneath which rivers flow. When-\never they are provided with fruit t herefrom as \nsustenance, they will say, \u201cThis is what we \nwere provided with before,\u201d and they will be \ngiven the like of it. And they will have pure \nspouses therein, and they will abide therein \nforever.  \n26. Allah does not shy away from making an \nexample of a  gnat, or something above it. As \nfor those who believe, they know that it is the \nTruth from their Lord. But as for those who \ndisbelieve, they say, \u201cWhat did Allah intend \nby this example?\u201d He leads astray many \nthereby, and He guides many thereby; but He \nmisleads thereby only the evildoers.  \n27.

How can you deny Allah, when you were \ndead and He gave yo u life, then He will put \nyou to death, then He will bring you to life, then to Him you will be returned?  \n29. It is He who created for you everything on \nearth, then turned to the heaven, and made \nthem seven heavens. And He is aware of all \nthings.  \n30.

And they said, \u201cOur hearts are sealed.\u201d Ra-\nther, Allah has cursed them for their ingrati-\ntude. They have little faith.  \n89. And when a scripture came to them from \nAllah, confirming what they have \u2014although \npreviously they were seeking victory against \nthose who disbelieved \u2014but when there came \nto them what they recognized, they disbe-\nlieved in it. So Allah\u2019s curse is upon the dis-\nbelievers.  \n90. Miserable is what they sold their souls \nfor\u2014rejecting what Allah has revealed, out of \nresentment that Allah would send down His \ngrace upon whomever He chooses from \namong His servants. Thus they incurred \nwrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning \npunishment for the disbelievers.  91. And when it is said to them, \u201cBelieve in \nwhat Allah has revealed,\u201d they say, \u201cWe be-\nlieve in what was revealed to us,\u201d and they re-\nject anything beyond that, although it is the \ntruth which confirms what they have. Say, \n\u201cWhy did you kill Allah\u2019s prophets before, if \nyou were believers?\u201d  \n92. Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet \nyou adopted the calf in his absence, and you \nwere in the wrong.  \n93. And We made a covenant with  you, and \nraised the Mount above you: \u201cTake what We have given you firmly, and listen.\u201d They said, \n\u201cWe hear and disobey.\u201d And their hearts be-\ncame filled with the love of the calf because of \ntheir disbelief. Say, \u201cWretched is what your \nfaith commands you to  do, if you are believ-\ners.\u201d  \n94. Say, \u201cIf the Final Home with Allah is yours \nalone, to the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death if you are sincere.\u201d  \n95. But they will never wish for it, because of \nwhat their hands have forwarded. Allah is \naware of the evildoers.  \n96. You will find them, of all mankind, the \nmost eager for life, even more than the poly-\ntheists. Every one of them wishes he could \nlive a thousand years; but to be granted a long \nlife will not nudge him from the punishment. \nAllah is Se eing of what they do.  \n97. Say, \u201cWhoever is hostile to Gabriel \u2014it is \nhe who revealed it to your heart by Allah\u2019s \nleave, confirming what preceded it, and guid-\nance and good news for the believers.\u201d  \n98. Whoever is hostile to Allah, and His angels, \nand His mess engers, and Gabriel, and Mi-\nchael \u2014Allah is hostile to the faithless.  \n99.

It was not Solo-\nmon who disbelieved, but it was the devils \nwho disbelieved. They taught the people \nwitchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon \nto the two angels Harut and Marut. They did not teach anybody until they had said, \u201cW e \nare a test, so do not lose faith.\u201d But they learned from them the means to cause sepa-\nration between man and his wife. But they \ncannot harm anyone except with Allah's per-\nmission. And they learned what would harm \nthem and not benefit them. Yet they knew \nthat whoever deals in it will have no share in \nthe Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold \ntheir souls for, if they only knew.  \n103. Had they believed and been righteous, the \nreward from Allah would have been better, if they only knew.  \n104. O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous \nwords, but say words of respect, and listen. \nThe disbelievers will have a painful torment.  \n105. It is never the wish of the disbelievers from \namong the People of the Book, nor of the pol-ytheists, that any good should be sent down \nto yo u from your Lord. But Allah chooses for \nHis mercy whomever He wills. Allah is Pos-\nsessor of Sublime Grace.  \n106. We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be \nforgotten, unless We bring one better than it, \nor similar to it. Do you not know that Allah \nis capab le of all things?  \n107. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the \nsovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and \nthat apart from Allah you have no guardian \nor helper?  \n108. Or do you want to question your Messen-\nger as Moses was questioned before? Who-\never exch anges faith for disbelief has strayed \nfrom the right path.  \n109.

In fact, whoever submits himself to Allah, \nand is a doer of good, will have his reward \nwith his Lord \u2014they have nothing to fear, nor \nshall the y grieve.  \n113. The Jews say, \u201cThe Christians are not \nbased on anything;\u201d and the Christians say, \u201cThe Jews are not based on anything.\u201d Yet they both read the Scripture. Similarly, the ig-\nnorant said the same thing. Allah will judge \nbetween them on the Day o f Resurrection re-\ngarding their differences.  \n114. Who is more unjust than him who forbids \nthe remembrance of Allah\u2019s name in places of worship, and contributes to their ruin? These ought not to enter them except in fear.

And obey Allah, and \nknow that to Him you will be gathered.  \n204. Among the people is he whose speech \nabout the worldly life impresses you, and he \ncalls Allah to witness what is in his heart, while he is the most hostile of adversaries.  \n205.

THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  \n225. Allah does not hold you responsible for \nyour unintentional oaths, but He holds you \nresponsible for your intentions. Allah is For-\ngiving and Forbearing.  \n226. Those who vow abstinence from their \nwives must wait for four months. But if they \nreconcile\u2014 Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  \n227. And if they resolve to divorce \u2014Allah is \nHearing and Knowing.  \n228. Divorced women shall wait by themselves \nfor three periods. And it is not lawful for \nthem to conceal what Allah has created in \ntheir wombs, if they believe in Allah and the \nLast Day. Meanwhile, their husbands have \nthe better right to take them back, if they de-\nsire reconciliation. And women have rights \nsimilar to their obligations, according to what \nis fai r. But men have a degree over them. Al-\nlah is Mighty and Wise.  \n229. Divorce is allowed twice. Then, either \nhonorable retention, or setting free kindly. It is not lawful for you to take back anything \nyou have given them, unless they fear that \nthey cannot mai ntain Allah's limits. If you \nfear that they cannot maintain Allah\u2019s limits, \nthen there is no blame on them if she sacri-\nfices something for her release. These are Al-\nlah\u2019s limits, so do not transgress them. Those \nwho transgress Allah\u2019s limits are the unjust.  \n230. If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful \nfor him again until she has married another \nhusband. If the latter divorces her, then there \nis no blame on them for reuniting, provided \nthey think they can maintain Allah's limits. \nThese are Allah\u2019s limits;  He makes them clear \nto people who know.  \n231. When you divorce women, and they have \nreached their term, either retain them amica-\nbly, or release them amicably. But do not re-\ntain them to hurt them and commit aggres-\nsion. Whoever does that has wronged him-\nself. And do not take Allah\u2019s revelations for a \njoke. And remember Allah's favor to you, and \nthat He revealed to you the Scripture and \nWisdom to teach you. And fear Allah, and \nknow that Allah is aware of everything.  232. When you divorce women, and they have \nreached their term, do not prevent them from \nmarrying their husbands, provided they \nagree on fair terms. Thereby is advised who-\never among you believes in Allah and the Last \nDay. That is better and more decent for you. \nAllah knows, and you do not know.  \n233. Mothers may nurse their infants for two \nwhole years, for those who desire to complete \nthe nursing -period. It is the duty of the father \nto provide for them and clothe them in a \nproper manner. No soul shall be burdened \nbeyond its capacity. No mother shall be \nharmed on account of her child, and no fa-\nther shall be harmed on account of his child. \nThe same duty rests upon the heir. If the cou-\nple desire weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, they commit no error by doing \nso. You commit no error by hiring nurs ing-\nmothers, as long as you pay them fairly. And \nbe wary of Allah, and know that Allah is See-\ning of what you do.  \n234. As for those among you who die and leave \nwidows behind, their widows shall wait by \nthemselves for four months and ten days. \nWhen they have  reached their term, there is \nno blame on you regarding what they might \nhonorably do with themselves.

Spend from what We \nhave given you, before a Day comes in which there is neither trading, nor friendship, nor \nintercession. The disbelievers are the wrong-\ndoers.  \n255. Allah! There is no god except He, the Liv-\ning, the Everlasting. Neither slumber over-\ntakes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs every-\nthing in the heavens and everything on earth. \nWho is he that can intercede with Him except \nwith His permission? He knows what is be-\nfore them, and what is behind them; and they \ncannot grasp any of His knowledge, except as \nHe wills. His Throne extends over the heav-\nens and the earth, and their preservation does not burden Him. He is the Most High, the \nGreat.  \n256. There shall be no compu lsion in religion; \nthe right way has become distinct from the wrong way.

Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.  259. Or like him who passed by a town col-\nlapsed on its foundations. He said, \u201cHow can \nAllah revive this after its demise?\u201d Thereupon \nAllah caused him to die for a hundred years, \nand then resurrected him. He said, \u201cFor how \nlong have you tarried?\u201d He said, \u201cI have tar-\nried for a day, or part of a day.\u201d He said, \u201cNo. \nYou have tarried for a hundred years. Now \nlook at your food and your drink \u2014it has not \nspoiled \u2014and look at your d onkey. We will \nmake you a wonder for mankind. And look at the bones, how We arrange them, and then \nclothe them with flesh.\u201d So when it became \nclear to him, he said, \u201cI know that Allah has \npower over all things.\u201d  \n260. And when Abraham said, \u201cMy Lord, show \nme how You give life to the dead.\u201d He said, \n\u201cHave you not believed?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, but \nto put my heart at ease.\u201d He said, \u201cTake four \nbirds, and incline them to yourself, then place \na part on each hill, then call to them; and they \nwill come rushing to you.

Thus Allah makes clear \nthe si gns for you, so that you may reflect.  \n267. O you who believe! Give of the good \nthings you have earned, and from what We \nhave produced for you from the earth. And \ndo not pick the inferior things to give away, \nwhen you yourselves would not accept it ex-\ncept w ith eyes closed. And know that Allah is \nSufficient and Praiseworthy.  \n268.

Those who swallow usury will not rise, ex-\ncept as someone driven mad by Satan's touch. \nThat is because they say, \u201cCommerce is like \nusury.\u201d But Allah has permitted commerce, \nand has forbidden usury.

FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali \u2018Imran)  \n10. As for those who disbelieve, neither their \nwealth nor their children will avail them any-\nthing against Allah. These wi ll be fuel for the \nFire.  \n11. Like the behavior of Pharaoh\u2019s people and \nthose before them. They rejected Our signs, \nso Allah seized them for their sins. Allah is \nStrict in retribution.  \n12. Say to those who disbelieve, \u201cYou will be \ndefeated, and rounded up i nto Hell \u2014an aw-\nful resting -place.\u201d  \n13. There was a sign for you in the two parties \nthat met. One party fighting in the way of Al-\nlah, and the other was disbelieving. They saw \nthem with their own eyes twice their number. \nBut Allah supports with His help whome ver \nHe wills. In that is a lesson for those with in-sight.  \n14. Adorned for the people is the love of de-\nsires, such as women, and children, and piles \nupon piles of gold and silver, and branded \nhorses, and livestock, and fields. These are \nthe conveniences of the worldly life, but with \nAllah lies the finest resort.  \n15. Say, \u201cShall I inform you of something bet-\nter than that? For those who are righteous, \nwith their Lord are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will remain forever, \nand purified spouses, and acceptance from \nAllah.\u201d Allah is Observant of the servants.  \n16. Those who say, \u201cOur Lord, we have be-\nlieved, so forgive us our sins, and save us \nfrom the suffering of the Fire.\u201d  \n17. The patient, and the truthful, and the rev-\nerent, and the charitable, and  the seekers of \nforgiveness at dawn.  \n18. Allah bears witness that there is no god but \nHe, as do the angels, and those endowed with \nknowledge \u2014upholding justice. There is no \ngod but He, the Mighty, the Wise.  \n19. Religion with Allah is Islam. Those to \nwhom the Scripture was given differed only after knowledge came to them, out of envy among themselves. Whoever rejects the signs \nof Allah\u2014 Allah is quick to take account.  20. If they argue with you, say, \u201cI have surren-\ndered myself to Allah, and those who follow \nme.\u201d And say to those who were given the \nScripture, and to the unlearned, \u201cHave you \nsurrendered?\u201d If they have surrendered, then \nthey are guided; but if they turn away, then \nyour duty is to convey. Allah is Seeing of the \nservants.  \n21. As for those who defy Allah\u2019s revelations, \nand kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those \nwho advocate justice among the people\u2014\npromise them a painful retribution.  \n22. They are those whose deeds will come to \nnothing, in this world and in the Hereafter; and they will have no savi ors. \n23. Have you not considered those who were \ngiven a share of the Scripture, as they were \ncalled to the Scripture of Allah to arbitrate be-\ntween them; then some of them turned back, \nand declined?  \n24. That is because they said, \u201cThe Fire will not \ntouch us  except for a limited number of \ndays.\u201d They have been misled in their religion \nby the lies they fabricated.  \n25. How about when We gather them for a \nDay in which there is no doubt, and each soul \nwill be paid in full for what it has earned, and \nthey will not be wronged?  \n26. Say, \u201cO Allah, Owner of Sovereignty. You \ngrant sovereignty to whom You will, and You \nstrip sovereignty from whom you will. You honor whom you will, and You humiliate \nwhom you will. In Your hand is all goodness. \nYou are Capable of all thing s.\u201d \n27. \u201cYou merge the night into the day, and \nYou merge the day into the night; and you \nbring the living out of the dead, and You \nbring the dead out of the living; and You pro-\nvide for whom you will without measure.\u201d  \n28. Believers are not to take disbeliev ers for \nfriends instead of believers. Whoever does \nthat has nothing to do with Allah, unless it is to protect your own selves against them.

And when she delivered her, she said, \u201cMy \nLord, I have delivered a female,\u201d and Allah \nwas well aware of what she has  delivered, \n\u201cand the male is not like the female, and I \nhave named her Mary, and have commended \nher and her descendants to Your protection, \nfrom Satan the outcast.\u201d  \n37.

Thereupon Zechariah prayed to his Lord; \nhe said, \u201cMy Lord, bestow on me good off-\nspring from Your presence; You are the \nHearer of Prayers.\u201d  \n39. Then the angels called out to him, as he \nstood praying in the sanctuary: \u201cAllah gives you good news of Joh n; confirming a Word \nfrom Allah, and honorable, and moral, and a \nprophet; one of the upright.\u201d  \n40. He said, \u201cMy Lord, how will I have a son, \nwhen old age has overtaken me, and my wife \nis barren?\u201d He said, \u201cEven so, Allah does \nwhatever He wills.\u201d  \n41. He said, \u201cMy Lord, give me a sign.\u201d He said, \n\u201cYour sign is that you shall not speak to the \npeople for three days, except by gestures. And \nremember your Lord much, and praise in the \nevening and the morning.\u201d  \n42. The angels said, \u201cO Mary, Allah has chosen \nyou, an d has purified you.

You were not with \nthem when they ca st their lots as to which of \nthem would take charge of Mary; nor were \nyou with them as they quarreled.  \n45.

The f irst house established for mankind is \nthe one at Bekka; blessed, and guidance for all \npeople.  \n97. In it are evident signs; the Station of Abra-\nham. Whoever enters it attains security. Pil-\ngrimage to the House is a duty to Allah for all \nwho can make the journ ey. But as for those \nwho refuse \u2014Allah is Independent of the \nworlds.  \n98. Say, \u201cO People of the Scripture, why do you \nreject the Revelations of Allah, when Allah \nwitnesses what you do?\u201d  \n99. Say, \u201cO People of the Scripture, why do you \nhinder from Allah\u2019s path those who believe, \nseeking to distort it, even though you are wit-nesses? Allah is not unaware of what you do.\u201d  \n100. O you who believe! If you obey a party of \nthose who were given the Scripture, they will \nturn you, after your belief, into disbelievers.  \n101. And how could you disbelieve, when Al-\nlah\u2019s revelations are being recited to you, and among you is His Messenger? Whoever \ncleaves to Allah has been guided to a straight \npath.  \n102. O you who believe! Revere Allah with due \nreverence, and do not die except a s Muslims.  \n103. And hold fast to the rope of Allah, alto-\ngether, and do not become divided. And re-\nmember Allah\u2019s blessings upon you; how you were enemies, and He reconciled your hearts, \nand by His grace you became brethren. And \nyou were on the brink of a pi t of fire, and He \nsaved you from it. Allah thus clarifies His rev-elations for you, so that you may be guided.  \n104. And let there be among you a community \ncalling to virtue, and advocating righteous-\nness, and deterring from evil. These are the \nsuccessful.  105. And do not be like those who separated \nand disputed after the clear proofs came to them; for them is a great punishment.  \n106. On the Day when some faces will be whit-\nened, and some faces will be blackened. As \nfor those whose faces are blackened: \u201cDid you  \ndisbelieve after your belief?\u201d Then taste the \npunishment for having disbelieved.  \n107. But as for those whose faces are whitened: \nthey are in Allah\u2019s mercy, remaining in it for-\never.  \n108. These are the revelations of Allah. We re-\ncite them to you in truth. Allah desires no in-\njustice for mankind.  \n109. To Allah belongs everything in the heav-\nens and everything on earth, and to Allah all events are referred.  \n110. You are the best community that ever \nemerged for humanity: you advocate what is \nmoral, and forbid what is immoral, and be-\nlieve in Allah. Had the People of the Scripture \nbelieved, it would have been better for them. \nAmong them are the believers, but most of \nthem are sinners.  \n111. They will do you no harm, beyond insult-\ning you. And if they fight you, they w ill turn \naround and flee, then they will not be helped.  \n112. They shall be humiliated wherever they \nare encountered, except through a rope from \nAllah, and a rope from the people; and they \nincurred wrath from Allah, and were stricken with misery. That is be cause they rejected Al-\nlah\u2019s revelations, and killed the prophets un-\njustly. That is because they rebelled and com-\nmitted aggression.  \n113. They are not alike. Among the People of \nthe Scripture is a community that is upright; \nthey recite Allah\u2019s revelations th roughout the \nnight, and they prostrate themselves.  \n114. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, \nand advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and are quick to do good deeds. These are \namong the righteous.  \n115.

These are the inhab-\nitants of the Fire, abiding therein forever.  \n117. The parable of what they spend in this  \nworldly life is that of a frosty wind that strikes \nthe harvest of a people who have wronged \ntheir souls, and destroys it. Allah did not \nwrong them, but they wronged their own \nselves.  \n118. O you who believe! Do not befriend out-\nsiders who never cease to wis h you harm. \nThey love to see you suffer. Hatred has al-\nready appeared from their mouths, but what \ntheir hearts conceal is worse. We have made \nthe messages clear for you, if you understand.  \n119. There you are, you love them, but they do \nnot love you, and you  believe in the entire \nscripture. And when they meet you, they say, \n\u201cWe believe;\u201d but when they are alone, they \nbite their fingers in rage at you.

When two groups among you almost fal-\ntered, but Allah was their Protector. So in Al-\nlah let the believers put their trust.  \n123. Allah had given you victory at Badr, when \nyou were weak. So fear A llah, that you may be \nthankful.  \n124.

It is; but if you persevere and remain cau-\ntious, and they attack you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand \nangels, well trained.  126. Allah made it but a message of hope for \nyou, and to reassure your hearts thereby. Vic-\ntory comes only from Allah the Almighty, the \nWise.  \n127. He thus cuts off a section of those who dis-\nbelieved, or subdues them, so they retreat dis-\nappointed.  \n128. It is no concern of yours whether He re-\ndeems them or punishes them. They are \nwrongdoers.  \n129. To Allah belongs everything in the heav-\nens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, \nand He punishe s whom He wills. Allah is \nMost Forgiving, Most Merciful.  \n130. O you who believe! Do not feed on usury, \ncompounded over and over, and fear Allah, \nso that you may prosper.  \n131. And guard yourselves against the Fire that \nis prepared for the disbelievers.  \n132. And obey Allah and the Messenger, that \nyou may obtain mercy.  \n133. And race towards forgiveness from your \nLord, and a Garden as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.  \n134. Those who give in prosperity and adver-\nsity, and those who r estrain anger, and those \nwho forgive people. Allah loves the doers of good.  \n135.

FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali \u2018Imran)  \nwho marched in the land, or went on the of-\nfensive, \u201cHad they stayed with us, they would \nnot have died or been ki lled.\u201d So that Allah \nmay make it a cause of regret in their hearts. \nAllah gives life and causes death. Allah is See-\ning of what you do.  \n157. If you are killed in the cause of Allah, or \ndie\u2014 forgiveness and mercy from Allah are \nbetter than what they hoard.  \n158. If you die, or are killed \u2014to Allah you will \nbe gathered up.  \n159. It is by of grace from Allah that you were \ngentle with them. Had you been harsh, hard-\nhearted, they would have dispersed from \naround you. So pardon them, and ask for-\ngiveness for them, and c onsult them in the \nconduct of affairs. And when you make a de-\ncision, put your trust in Allah; Allah loves the \ntrusting.  \n160. If Allah supports you, there is none who \ncan overcome you. But if He fails you, who is \nthere to help you after Him? So in Allah let  \nthe believers put their trust.  \n161. It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. \nWhoever acts dishonestly will bring his dis-honesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then \nevery soul will be paid in full for what it has \nearned, and they will not be wronged.  \n162. Is someone who pursues Allah's approval \nthe same as someone who incurs Allah's \nwrath and his refuge is Hell \u2014the miserable \ndestination?  \n163. They have different ranks with Allah, and \nAllah is Seeing of what they do.  \n164. Allah has blessed the believers, as He \nraised up among them a messenger from \namong themselves, who recites to them His \nrevelations, and purifies them, and teaches \nthem the Scripture and wisdom; although be-\nfore that they were in evident error.  \n165. And when a calamity befell you, even after \nyou had inflicted twice as much, you said, \n\u201cHow is this?\u201d Say, \u201cIt is from your own selves.\u201d Allah is Able to do all things.  166. What befell you on the day the two armies \nclashed was with Allah\u2019s permission; that He \nmay know the believers.  \n167. And that He  may know the hypocrites. \nAnd it was said to them, \u201cCome, fight in the \ncause of Allah, or contribute.\u201d They said, \u201cIf \nwe knew how to fight, we would have fol-\nlowed you.\u201d On that day they were closer to \ninfidelity than they were to faith. They say \nwith their  mouths what is not in their hearts; \nbut Allah knows what they hide.  \n168. Those who said of their brethren, as they \nstayed behind, \u201cHad they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.\u201d Say, \u201cThen avert \ndeath from yourselves, if you are truthful.\u201d  \n169. Do not consider those killed in the cause \nof Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive, at their \nLord, well provided for.  \n170. Delighting in what Allah has given them \nout of His grace, and happy for those who have not yet joined them; that they have \nnothing to f ear, nor will they grieve.  \n171. They rejoice in grace from Allah, and \nbounty, and that Allah will not waste the re-\nward of the faithful.  \n172. Those who responded to Allah and the \nMessenger, despite the persecution they had \nsuffered. For the virtuous and the  pious \namong them is a great reward.  \n173. Those to whom the people have said, \u201cThe \npeople have mobilized against you, so fear them.\u201d But this only increased them in faith, and they said, \u201cAllah is enough for us; He is \nthe Excellent Protector.\u201d  \n174. So they  came back with grace from Allah, \nand bounty, and no harm having touched them. They pursued what pleases Allah. Al-\nlah possesses immense grace.  \n175. That is only Satan frightening his parti-\nsans; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you \nare believers.  \n176. And do not be saddened by those who \nrush into disbelief.

A humiliating torment \nawaits them.  \n179. Allah will not leave the b elievers as you \nare, without distinguishing the wicked from \nthe sincere. Nor will Allah inform you of the future, but Allah elects from among His mes-\nsengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah \nand His messengers. If you believe and prac-\ntice piety, you will have a splendid reward.  \n180. Those who withhold what Allah has given \nthem of his bounty should not assume that is \ngood for them. In fact, it is bad for them. They will be encircled by their hoardings on \nthe Day of Resurrection.

We did not send any messenger except to \nbe obeyed by Allah\u2019s leave. Had they, when \nthey wronged themselves, come to you, and prayed for Allah's forgiveness, and the Mes-\nsenger had prayed for their forgiveness, they \nwould have found Allah Relenting and Mer-\nciful.  \n65. But no, by your Lord, they will not believe \nuntil they call you to arbitrate in their dis-\nputes, and then find within themselves no re-sentment regarding your decisions, and sub-\nmit themselves completely.  \n66. Had We decreed for them: \u201cKill your-\nselves,\u201d or \u201cLeave your homes,\u201d they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But \nhad they done what they were instructed to \ndo, it would have been better for  them, and a \nfirmer confirmation.  \n67. And We would have given them from Our \npresence a rich compensation.  \n68. And We would have guided them on a \nstraight path.  \n69. Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger \u2014\nthese are with those whom Allah has \nblessed \u2014among the prophets, and the sin-\ncere, and the martyrs, and the upright. Excel-\nlent are those as companions.  \n70. That is the grace from Allah. Allah suffices \nas Knower.  \n71. O you who believe! Take your precautions, \nand mobilize in groups, or mobilize alto-gether.  \n72. Among you is he who lags behind. Then, \nwhen a calamity befalls you, he says, \u201cAllah \nhas favored me, that I was not martyred with \nthem.\u201d  73. But when some bounty from Allah comes \nto you, he says \u2014as if no affection existed be-\ntween you and him \u2014\u201cIf only I had be en with \nthem, I would have achieved a great victory.\u201d  \n74. Let those who sell the life of this world for \nthe Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah. \nWhoever fights in the cause of Allah, and \nthen is killed, or achieves victory, We will \ngrant him a great comp ensation.  \n75. And why would you not fight in the cause \nof Allah, and the helpless men, and women, \nand children, cry out, \u201cOur Lord, deliver us from this town whose people are oppressive, \nand appoint for us from Your Presence a Pro-\ntector, and appoint for us  from Your Pres-\nence a Victor.\u201d  \n76. Those who believe fight in the cause of Al-\nlah, while those who disbelieve fight in the cause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil. \nSurely the strategy of the Devil is weak.  \n77. Have you not considered those who were \ntold, \u201cRestrain your hands, and perform your \nprayers, and spend in regular charity\u201d? But when fighting was ordained for them, a fac-\ntion of them feared the people as Allah is \nought to be feared, or even more. And they \nsaid, \u201cOur Lord, why did You ordain fighting \nfor us? If only You would postpone it for us \nfor a short while.\u201d Say, \u201cThe enjoyments of \nthis life are brief, but the Hereafter is better \nfor the righteous, and you will not be \nwronged one bit.\u201d  \n78. Wherever you may be, death will catch up \nwith you, even if you were in fortified towers. \nWhen a good fortune comes their way, they \nsay, \u201cThis is from Allah.\u201d But when a misfor-\ntune befalls them, they say, \u201cThis is from \nyou.\u201d Say, \u201cAll is from Allah.\u201d So what is the \nmatter with these people, that they hardly  un-\nderstand a thing?  \n79. Whatever good happens to you is from Al-\nlah, and whatever bad happens to you is from \nyour own self. We sent you to humanity as a \nmessenger, and Allah is Witness enough.  \n80. Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying \nAllah. And whoever turns away \u2014We did not \nsend you as a watcher over them.  \n31", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39e6f78e-6b82-4a5d-a857-91099cc60067": {"__data__": {"id_": "39e6f78e-6b82-4a5d-a857-91099cc60067", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65cb43bb-efa3-4fcb-b5f7-67593fafc9ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "fd8cc03028383c8ee928baccd824b95c3434a4c1d9c28615e6adeb5c50db43df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b816db2-cb27-43b9-b2ea-cc417dea8b25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "f881221de87cda530fb329bfda73cc990cca2ceb49ae02357c6f4ea17523e714", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a3e6e11-fa1f-46e0-934f-2bcdf797ff8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5249eedee40af6af0a81ed85c8eddd04bbd242aa0d44a866bbc5c2a9c705efc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "85008c3a5f108b70baa287821b9a48233663eca701421c585d341589fa7cdd79", "text": "4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa\u2019)  \n81. They profess obedience, but when they \nleave your presence, some of them conspire \nsomething contrary to what you said. But Al-\nlah writes down what they conspire. So avoid \nthem, and put your trust in Allah. Allah is \nGuardian enough.  \n82. Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it \nbeen from any other than Allah, they would \nhave found in it much discrepancy.  \n83. When some news of security or alarm \ncomes their way, they broadcast it. But had \nthey referred it to the Messenger, and to those in authority among them, those who can \ndraw conclusions from it would have com-\nprehended it. Were it not for Allah\u2019s blessing \nand mercy upon you, you would have fol-\nlowed the Devil, except for a few.  \n84. So fight in the cause of Allah; you are re-\nsponsible only for yourself. And rouse the be-\nlievers. Perhaps Allah will restrain the might \nof those who disbelieve. Allah is Stronger in \nMight, and More Punishing.  \n85. Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a \nshare in it, and whoever inte rcedes for an evil \ncause shares in its burdens. Allah keeps watch over everything.  \n86. When you are greeted with a greeting, re-\nspond with a better greeting, or return it. Al-\nlah keeps count of everything.  \n87. Allah \u2014there is no god except He. He will \ngather you to the Day of Resurrection, in \nwhich there is no doubt. And who speaks \nmore truly than Allah?  \n88. What is the matter with you, divided into \ntwo factions regarding the hypocrites, when \nAllah Himself has overwhelmed them on ac-\ncount of what they did? Do y ou want to guide \nthose whom Allah has led astray? Whomever \nAllah leads astray \u2014you will never find for \nhim a way.  \n89. They would love to see you disbelieve, just \nas they disbelieve, so you would become \nequal. So do not befriend any of them, unless \nthey emig rate in the way of Allah. If they turn \naway, seize them and execute them wherever you may find them; and do not take from \namong them allies or supporters.  \n90. Except those who join people with whom \nyou have a treaty, or those who come to you \nreluctant to f ight you or fight their own peo-\nple. Had Allah willed, He would have given \nthem power over you, and they would have \nfought you. If they withdraw from you, and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then \nAllah assigns no excuse for you against them.  \n91. You will find others who want security \nfrom you, and security from their own peo-ple. But whenever they are tempted into civil \ndiscord, they plunge into it. So if they do not \nwithdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor \nrestrain their hands, seize them and execu te \nthem wherever you find them. Against these, \nWe have given you clear authorization.  \n92. Never should a believer kill another be-\nliever, unless by error. Anyone who kills a be-\nliever by error must set free a believing slave, \nand pay compensation to the vict im\u2019s family, \nunless they remit it as charity. If the victim \nbelonged to a people who are hostile to you, \nbut is a believer, then the compensation is to \nfree a believing slave. If he belonged to a peo-\nple with whom you have a treaty, then com-\npensation should  be handed over to his fam-\nily, and a believing slave set free. Anyone who \nlacks the means must fast for two consecutive \nmonths, by way of repentance to Allah. Allah \nis All -Knowing, Most Wise.  \n93. Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the \npenalty for him i s Hell, where he will remain \nforever. And Allah will be angry with him, \nand will curse him, and will prepare for him \na terrible punishment.  \n94. O you who believe! When you journey in \nthe way of Allah, investigate, and do not say to him who offers you peac e, \u201cYou are not a \nbeliever,\u201d aspiring for the goods of this world. With Allah are abundant riches. You your-\nselves were like this before, and Allah be-\nstowed favor on you; so investigate.

You \ncommit no error, if you are hampered by rain or are sick, by putting down your weapons; \nbut take precautions.

Allah will not forgive that partners be as-\nsociated with Him; but will forgive anything less than that,  to whomever He wills. Anyone \nwho ascribes partners to Allah has strayed \ninto far error.  \n117. They invoke in His stead only females. In \nfact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil.  \n118. Allah has cursed him.

Souls are prone to ava-\nrice; yet if you do what is good, and practice \npiety \u2014Allah is Cognizant of what you do.  \n129. You will not be able to treat women with \nequal fairness, no matter how much you de-\nsire it. But do not be so biased as to leave an-\nother suspended.

To Allah belon gs everything in the heav-\nens and everything on earth. Allah suffices as \nManager.  \n133. If He wills, He can do away with you, O \npeople, and bring others. Allah is Able to do \nthat.  \n134. Whoever desires the reward of this \nworld \u2014with Allah is the reward of this  world \nand the next. Allah is All -Hearing, All -See-\ning. \n135. O you who believe! Stand firmly for jus-\ntice, as witnesses to Allah, even if against \nyourselves, or your parents, or your relatives. \nWhether one is rich or poor, Allah takes care \nof both. So do not follow your desires, lest \nyou swerve. If you deviate, or turn away \u2014\nthen Allah is Aware of what you do.  \n136. O you who believe! Believe in Allah and \nHis messenger, and the Book He sent down \nto His messenger, and the Book He sent \ndown before. Whoever reject s Allah, His an-\ngels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, has strayed far in error.  \n137. Those who believe, then disbelieve, then \nbelieve, then disbelieve, then increase in dis-belief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He \nguide them to a way.  \n138. Inform the hypocrites that they will have a \npainful punishment.  \n139. Those who ally themselves with the disbe-\nlievers instead of the believers. Do they seek glory in them? All glory belongs to Allah.  \n140. He has revealed to you in the Book that \nwhen you hear Allah\u2019s revelations being re-\njected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until \nthey engage in some other subject. Other-\nwise, you would be like them. Allah will \ngather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, into Hell, altogether.  \n141. Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain \nvictory from Allah, they say, \u201cWere we not \nwith you?\u201d But if the disbelievers get a turn, they say, \u201cDid we not side with you, and de-\nfend you from the believers?\u201d Allah will judge \nbetween you on the Day of Resurrection; and \nAllah wi ll give the disbelievers no means of \novercoming the believers.  \n142. The hypocrites try to deceive Allah, but He \nis deceiving them. And when they stand for \nprayer, they stand lazily, showing off in front \nof people, and remembering Allah only a lit-tle. \n143. Wavering in between, neither with these, \nnor with those. Whomever Allah sends \nastray, you will never find for him a way.  \n144. O you who believe! Do not befriend disbe-\nlievers rather than believers. Do you want to give Allah a clear case against you?  \n145. The hypocrites will be in the lowest level \nof the Fire, and you will find no helper for \nthem.  \n146. Except those who repent, and reform, and \nhold fast to Allah, and dedicate their religion to Allah alone. These are with the believers; \nand Allah will give the believers a great re-\nward.  \n147.

Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.  \n153. The People of the Scripture challenge you \nto bring down to them a book from the sky. They had asked Moses for something even \ngreater. They said, \u201cShow us Allah plainly.\u201d \nThe thunderbolt struck them for their wick-\nedness. Then they took the calf for worship, even after the clear proofs had come to them. \nYet We pardoned that, and We gave Moses a \nclear authority.  \n154. And We raised the Mount above them in \naccordance with their covenant, and We said to them, \u201cEnter the gate humbly\u201d, and We \nsaid to them, \u201cDo not violate the Sabbath\u201d, \nand We received from them a solemn pledge.  \n155. But for their violation of their covenant, \nand their denial of Allah\u2019s revelations, and \ntheir killing  of the prophets unjustly, and \ntheir saying, \u201cOur minds are closed.\u201d In fact, \nAllah has sealed them for their disbelief, so \nthey do not believe, except for a few.  \n156. And for their faithlessness, and their say-\ning against Mary a monstrous slander.  \n157. And  for their saying, \u201cWe have killed the \nMessiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messen-\nger of Allah.\u201d In fact, they did not kill him, \nnor did they crucify him, but it appeared to \nthem as if they did. Indeed, those who differ \nabout him are in doubt about it. The y have \nno knowledge of it, except the following of as-\nsumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him.  \n158. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. \nAllah is Mighty and Wise.  \n159. There is none from the People of the \nScripture but will believe in him before his \ndeath, and on the Day of Resurrection he will \nbe a witness against them.  \n160.

And for their taking usury,  although they \nwere forbidden it; and for their consuming people's wealth dishonestly. We have pre-\npared for the faithless among them a painful \ntorment.  \n162. But those among them firmly rooted in \nknowledge, and the believers, believe in what \nwas revealed to  you, and in what was revealed \nbefore you; and the observers of prayers, and \nthe givers of charity, and the believers in Al-\nlah and the Last Day \u2014upon these We will be-\nstow an immense reward.  \n163. We have inspired you, as We had inspired \nNoah and the prophets after him. And We in-spired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and \nJacob, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Job, \nand Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon. And \nWe gave David the Psalms.  \n164.

Those who disbelieve and transgress; Al-\nlah is not about to forgive them, nor will He \nguide them to any path.  \n169. Except to the path of Hell, where they will \ndwell forever.

When you rise to pray, \nwash your faces and your hands and arms to \nthe elbows, and wipe your heads, and your \nfeet to the ankles. If you had intercourse, then \npurif y yourselves. If you are ill, or travelling, \nor one of you returns from the toilet, or you \nhad contact with women, and could not find \nwater, then use some clean sand and wipe \nyour faces and hands with it. Allah does not \nintend to burden you, but He intends  to pu-\nrify you, and to complete His blessing upon \nyou, that you may be thankful.  \n7. And Remember Allah\u2019s blessings upon you, \nand His covenant which He covenanted with \nyou; when you said, \u201cWe hear and we obey.\u201d \nAnd remain conscious of Allah, for Allah \nknows  what the hearts contain.  \n8. O you who believe! Be upright to Allah, wit-\nnessing with justice; and let not the hatred of \na certain people prevent you from acting justly. Adhere to justice, for that is nearer to \npiety; and fear Allah. Allah is informed of \nwhat you do.  \n9. Allah has promised those who believe and \nwork righteousness: they will have for-\ngiveness and a great reward.  \n10. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our \nrevelations \u2014these are the inmates of Hell.  \n11. O you who believe! Remember Allah's \nblessings upon you; when certain people in-\ntended to extend their hands against you, and \nHe restrained their hands from you. So rev-\nerence Allah, and in Allah let the believers \nput their trust.  \n12. Allah received a pledge from the Children \nof Israel, and We raised among them twelve \nchiefs. Allah said, \u201cI am with you; if you per-\nform the prayer, and pay the alms, and be-\nlieve in My messengers and support them, \nand lend Allah a loan of righteousness; I will \nremit your sins, and admit you into Gardens \nbeneath whic h rivers flow. But whoever \namong you disbelieves afterwards has strayed \nfrom the right way.\u201d  13. Because of their breaking their pledge, We \ncursed them, and made their hearts hard. \nThey twist the words out of their context, and \nthey disregarded some of wha t they were re-\nminded of. You will always witness deceit \nfrom them, except for a few of them. But par-\ndon them, and overlook. Allah loves the do-\ners of good.  \n14. And from those who say, \u201cWe are Chris-\ntians,\u201d We received their pledge, but they ne-\nglected some of  what they were reminded of. \nSo We provoked enmity and hatred among \nthem until the Day of Resurrection; Allah will \nthen inform them of what they used to craft.  \n15.

THE TABLE   (al-Ma\u2019idah)  \nyou, and a warner; and Allah is Capable of \neverything.  \n20. When Moses  said to his people, \u201cO my \npeople, remember Allah\u2019s blessings upon \nyou, when He placed prophets among you, \nand made you kings, and gave you what He \nnever gave any other people.\u201d  \n21. \u201cO my people, enter the Holy Land which \nAllah has assigned for you, and do  not turn \nback, lest you return as losers.\u201d  \n22. They said, \u201cO Moses, there are tyrannical \npeople in it; we will not enter it until they \nleave it. If they leave it, we will be entering.\u201d  \n23. Two men of those who feared, but whom \nAllah had blessed, said, \u201cGo  at them by the \ngate; and when you have entered it, you will \nprevail. And put your trust in Allah, if you are \nbelievers.\u201d  \n24. They said, \u201cO Moses, we will not enter it, \never, as long as they are in it. So go ahead, you \nand your Lord, and fight. We are stay ing right \nhere.\u201d  \n25. He said, \u201cMy Lord! I have control only over \nmyself and my brother, so separate between \nus and between the wicked people.\u201d  \n26. He said, \u201cIt is forbidden for them for forty \nyears. They will wander aimlessly in the land. \nSo do not grieve over the defiant people.\u201d  \n27. And relate to them the true story of Adam's \ntwo sons: when they offered an offering, and it was accepted from one of them, but it was \nnot accepted from the other. He Said, \u201cI will \nkill you.\u201d He Said, \u201cAllah accepts only from \nthe righteous.\u201d  \n28. \u201cIf you extend your hand to kill me, I will \nnot extend my hand to kill you; for I fear Al-lah, Lord of the Worlds.\u201d  \n29. \u201cI would rather you bear my sin and your \nsin, and you become among the inmates of \nthe Fire. Such is the reward for the  evildoers.\u201d  \n30. Then His soul prompted him to kill his \nbrother, so he killed him, and became one of \nthe losers.  31. Then Allah sent a raven digging the \nground, to show him how to cover his broth-\ner's corpse. He said, \u201cWoe to me! I was unable \nto be like thi s raven, and bury my brother's \ncorpse.\u201d So he became full of regrets.  \n32. Because of that We ordained for the Chil-\ndren of Israel: that whoever kills a person\u2014\nunless it is for murder or corruption on \nearth \u2014it is as if he killed the whole of man-\nkind; and who ever saves it, it is as if he saved \nthe whole of mankind. Our messengers came \nto them with clarifications, but even after \nthat, many of them continue to commit ex-\ncesses in the land.  \n33. The punishment for those who fight Allah \nand His Messenger, and strive  to spread cor-\nruption on earth, is that they be killed, or cru-\ncified, or have their hands and feet cut off on \nopposite sides, or be banished from the land. \nThat is to disgrace them in this life; and in the \nHereafter they will have a terrible punish-\nment.  \n34. Except for those who repent before you ap-\nprehend them. So know that Allah is Forgiv-ing and Merciful.  \n35. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, \nand seek the means of approach to Him, and \nstrive in His cause, so that you may succeed.  \n36.  As for those who disbelieve, even if they \nowned everything on earth, and the like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom them-\nselves from the torment of the Day of Resur-\nrection, it will not be accepted from them. \nFor them is a painful punishment.  \n37.

THE TABLE   (al-Ma\u2019idah)  \npunishes whom He wills, and He forgives \nwhom He wills. And Allah is  Capable of eve-\nrything.  \n41. O Messenger! Do not let those who are \nquick to disbelief grieve you \u2014from among \nthose who say with their mouths, \u201cWe be-\nlieve,\u201d but their hearts do not believe; and \nfrom among the Jews \u2014listeners to lies, lis-\nteners to other people who did not come to \nyou. They distort words from their places, and they say, \u201cIf you are given this, accept it; but if you are not given it, beware.\u201d Whom-\never Allah has willed to divert, you have \nnothing for him from Allah. Those are they \nwhose hearts Alla h does not intend to purify. \nFor them is disgrace in this world, and for \nthem is a great punishment in the Hereafter.  \n42. Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit \nearnings. If they come to you, judge between \nthem, or turn away from them. If you turn \naway  from them, they will not harm you in \nthe least. But if you judge, judge between them equitably. Allah loves the equitable.  \n43. But why do they come to you for judgment, \nwhen they have the Torah, in which is Allah\u2019s \nLaw? Yet they turn away after that. Thes e are \nnot believers.  \n44. We have revealed the Torah, wherein is \nguidance and light. The submissive prophets \nruled the Jews according to it, so did the rab-\nbis and the scholars, as they were required to \nprotect Allah\u2019s Book, and were witnesses to it. \nSo do n ot fear people, but fear Me. And do \nnot sell My revelations for a cheap price. Those who do not rule according to what Al-\nlah revealed are the unbelievers.  \n45. And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, \nan eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for \nan ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it \nin charity, it will serve as atonement for him. \nThose who do not rule according to what Al-\nlah revealed are the evildoers.  \n46. In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of \nMary,  fulfilling the Torah that preceded him; \nand We gave him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, and confirming the To-\nrah that preceded him, and guidance and \ncounsel for the righteous.  \n47. So let the people of the Gospel rule accord-\ning to what Allah rev ealed in it. Those who \ndo not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners.  \n48. And We revealed to you the Book, with \ntruth, confirming the Scripture that preceded \nit, and superseding it. So judge between them \naccording to what Allah revealed, and  do not \nfollow their desires if they differ from the \ntruth that has come to you. For each of you \nWe have assigned a law and a method. Had \nAllah willed, He could have made you a single nation, but He tests you through what He has \ngiven you. So compete in ri ghteousness. To \nAllah is your return, all of you; then He will \ninform you of what you had disputed.  \n49. And judge between them according to \nwhat Allah revealed, and do not follow their \ndesires. And beware of them, lest they lure you away from some of what Allah has re-\nvealed to you. But if they turn away, know that Allah intends to strike them with some \nof their sins. In fact, a great many people are \ncorrupt.  \n50. Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that \nthey desire? Who is better than Allah in judg-\nment f or people who are certain?  \n51. O you who believe! Do not take the Jews \nand the Christians as allies; some of them are \nallies of one another. Whoever of you allies himself with them is one of them.

THE TABLE   (al-Ma\u2019idah)  \n54. O you who believe! Whoever of you goes \nback on his religion\u2014 Allah will bring a peo-\nple whom He loves and who love Him, kind \ntowards the believers, stern with the disbe-\nlievers. They strive in the way of Allah, and \ndo not fear the blame of the critic. That is the \ngrace of Allah; He bestows it upon whomever \nHe wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.  \n55. Your allies are Allah, and His Messenger, \nand those who believe \u2014those who pray reg-\nularly, and give charity, and bow down.  \n56. Whoever allies himself with Allah, and His \nMessenger, and those who believe \u2014surely \nthe Party of Allah is the victorious.  \n57. O you who believe! Do not befriend those \nwho take your religion in mockery and as a \nsport, be they from among those who were \ngiven the Scripture before you, or the disbe-\nlievers. And obey Allah, if you are believers.  \n58. When you call to the prayer,  they take it as \na joke and a trifle. That is because they are \npeople who do not reason.  \n59. Say, \u201cO People of the Scripture! Do you re-\nsent us only because we believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to us, and in what was \nrevealed previously; and most of you are sin-\nners?\u201d  \n60. Say, \u201cShall I inform you of worse than that \nfor retribution from Allah? He whom Allah \nhas cursed, and with whom He became an-\ngry; and He turned some of them into apes, \nand swine, and idol worshipers. These are in \na worse position, a nd further away from the \nright way.\u201d  \n61. When they come to you, they say, \u201cWe be-\nlieve,\u201d though they have entered with disbe-\nlief, and they have departed with it. But Allah \nis well aware of what they hide.  \n62. You see many of them competing with one \nanother in sin and hostility, and their con-\nsuming of what is illicit. What they have been doing is truly evil.  \n63. Why do the rabbis and the priests not pre-\nvent them from speaking sinfully and from \nconsuming forbidden wealth? Evil is what \nthey have been doing.  64. The Jews say, \u201cAllah\u2019s hand is tied.\u201d It is \ntheir hands that are tied, and they are cursed \nfor what they say. In fact, His hands are out-\nstretched; He gives as He wills. Certainly, \nwhat was revealed to your from your Lord \nwill increase many of them in defiance and \nblasphemy. And We placed between them \nenmity and hatred, until the Day of Resurrec-\ntion. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, \nAllah extinguishes it. And they strive to spread corruption on earth. Allah does not \nlove the corrupters.  \n65. Had the People of the Scriputure believed \nand been righteous, We would have remitted their sins, and admitted them into the Gar-\ndens of Bliss.  \n66. Had they observed the Torah, and the Gos-\npel, and what was revealed to them from their \nLord, they would have consumed a mply from \nabove them, and from beneath their feet. \nAmong them is a moderate community, but \nevil is what many of them are doing.  \n67. O Messenger, convey what was revealed to \nyou from your Lord. But if you do not, then \nyou would not have delivered His messa ge. \nAnd Allah will protect you from the people. \nAllah does not guide the disbelieving people.  \n68.

THE TABLE   (al-Ma\u2019idah)  \n71. They assumed there would be no punish-\nment, so they turned blind and deaf. Then Al-\nlah redeemed them, but then again many of \nthem turned blind and deaf. But Allah is See-\ning of what they do.  \n72. They disbelieve those who say, \u201c Allah is the \nMessiah the son of Mary.\u201d But the Messiah \nhimself said, \u201cO Children of Israel, worship \nAllah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever as-\nsociates others with Allah, Allah has forbid-\nden him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. \nThe wrongdoers have no s aviors.\u201d  \n73. They disbelieve those who say, \u201cAllah is the \nthird of three.\u201d But there is no deity except \nthe One God. If they do not refrain from what they say, a painful torment will befall those \namong them who disbelieve.  \n74. Will they not repent to Allah and ask His \nforgiveness? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  \n75. The Messiah son of Mary was only a mes-\nsenger, before whom other Messengers had \npassed away, and his mother was a woman of \ntruth. They both used to eat food. Note how \nWe make clear the revelatio ns to them; then \nnote how deluded they are.  \n76.

Do not ex-\naggerate in your religion beyond the trut h; \nand do not follow the opinions of people who \nwent astray before, and misled many, and \nthemselves strayed off the balanced way.\u201d  \n78. Cursed were those who disbelieved from \namong the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. That is  because \nthey rebelled and used to transgress.  \n79. They used not to prevent one another from \nthe wrongs they used to commit. Evil is what \nthey used to do.  \n80. You will see many of them befriending \nthose who disbelieve. Terrible is what their \nsouls prompts them to do. The wrath of Allah \nfell upon them, and in the torment they will \nremain.  81. Had they believed in Allah and the \nProphet, and in what was revealed to him, \nthey would not have befriended them. But \nmany of them are immoral.  \n82. You will find that t he people most hostile \ntowards the believers are the Jews and the \npolytheists. And you will find that the nearest \nin affection towards the believers are those \nwho say, \u201cWe are Christians.\u201d That is because \namong them are priests and monks, and they \nare not arrogant.  \n83. And when they hear what was revealed to \nthe Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing \nwith tears, as they recognize the truth in it. \nThey say, \u201cOur Lord, we have believed, so \ncount us among the witnesses.\u201d  \n84. \u201cAnd why should we not believe i n Allah, \nand in the truth that has come to us, and hope \nthat our Lord will include us among the \nrighteous people?\u201d  \n85.

The atone-ment for it i s by feeding ten needy people \nfrom the average of what you feed your fam-ilies, or by clothing them, or by freeing a \nslave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast \nfor three days. That is the atonement for \nbreaking your oaths when you have sworn \nthem. So keep  your oaths.

In fact, it is Him you will call upon; and if \nHe wills, he will remove what you called Him for, and you will forget what you idolized.  \n42.

But as for those who reject Our revelations, \ntorment will afflict them because of their de-\nfiance.  \n50. Say, \u201cI do not say to you that I possess the \ntreasuries of Allah, nor do I know the future, \nnor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only \nfollow what i s inspired to me.\u201d Say, \u201cAre the \nblind and the seeing alike? Do you not think?\u201d  \n51. And warn with it those who fear to be gath-\nered before their Lord \u2014they have no protec-\ntor or intercessor apart from him \u2014perhaps \nthey will grow in piety.  \n52. And do not drive away those who call upon \ntheir Lord, morning and evening, seeking His \nattention. You are not accountable for them \nin any way, nor are they accountable for you \nin any way. If you drive them away, you \nwould be one of the unjust.  \n53. Thus We try some of them by means of \nothers, that they may say, \u201cAre these the ones \nwhom Allah has favored from among us?\u201d Is \nAllah not aware of the appreciative?  \n54. When those who believe in Our revelations \ncome to you, say, \u201cPeace be upon you, your \nLord has prescribed mercy for  Himself. \nWhoever among you does wrong out of igno-\nrance, and then repents afterwards and re-\nforms \u2014He is Forgiving and Merciful.\u201d  \n55. Thus We explain the revelations, and ex-\npose the path of the unrighteous.  \n56. Say, \u201cI am forbidden from worshiping \nthose you pray to besides Allah.\u201d Say, \u201cI will \nnot follow your desires; else I would be lost and not be of those guided.\u201d  \n57. Say, \u201cI stand on clear evidence from my \nLord, and you have rejected Him. I do not \npossess what you seek me to hasten; the deci-sion belongs s olely to Allah. He states the \ntruth, and He is the Best of Judges.\u201d  \n58. Say, \u201cIf I possessed what you seek me to \nhasten, the matter between you and me would have been settled. Allah is well aware \nof the unjust.\u201d  \n59. With Him are the keys of the unseen; non e \nknows them except He. And He knows eve-\nrything on land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls \nbut He knows it; and there is not a single \ngrain in the darkness of earth, nor is there an-\nything wet or dry, but is in a clear record.  \n60. It is He Who takes you by ni ght, and He \nknows what you earn by day. Then He raises \nyou up in it, until a fixed term is fulfilled. \nThen to Him is your return, then He will in-\nform you of what you used to do.  \n61. He is the Conqueror over His servants, and \nHe sends guardians over you, un til, when \ndeath overtakes one of you, Our envoys take \nhim away, and they never fail.  \n62. Then they are brought back to Allah, their \nTrue Master. Unquestionably, His is the \njudgment, and He is the Swiftest of reckon-\ners. \n63.

Say, \u201cIt is Allah who delivers you from it, \nand from every disaster. Yet then you associ-ate others with Him.\u201d  \n65. Say, \u201cHe is Able to send upon you an afflic-\ntion, from above you, or from under your \nfeet. Or He can divide you into factions, and \nmake you taste the violence of one another. \nNote how We explain the revelations, so that \nthey may understand.\u201d  \n66. But your pe ople rejected it, though it is the \ntruth. Say, \u201cI am not responsible for you.\u201d  \n67. For every happening is a finality, and you \nwill surely know.  \n68.

He said, \u201cIn it you will live, and in it you \nwill die, and from it you will be brought out.\u201d  \n26. O children of Adam! We have provided \nyou with clothing to cover your bodies, and for luxury. But the clothing of piety \u2014that is \nbest. These are some of Allah\u2019s revelations, so \nthat they may take heed.  \n27. O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan se-\nduce you, as he drove your parents out of the \nGarden, stripping them of their garments, to \nshow them their  nakedness. He sees you, him \nand his clan, from where you cannot see \nthem. We have made the devils friends of \nthose who do not believe.  \n28. And when they commit an indecency, they \nsay, \u201cWe found our parents doing this, and \nAllah has commanded us to do it.\u201d  Say, \u201cAl-\nlah does not command indecencies. Are you \nattributing to Allah what you do not know?\u201d  \n29. Say, \u201cMy Lord commands justice, and to \nstand devoted at every place of worship. So \ncall upon Him, and dedicate your faith to Him alone. Just as He originated  you, so you \nwill return.\u201d  \n30.  Some He has guided, and some have de-\nserved misguidance. They have adopted the \ndevils for patrons rather than Allah, and they \nassume that they are guided.  \n31. O Children of Adam! Dress properly at \nevery place of worship, and eat and drink, but \ndo not be excessive. He does not love the ex-\ncessive.  \n32. Say, \u201cWho forbade Allah\u2019s finery which He \nhas produced for His servants, and the de-\nlights of livelihood?\u201d Say, \u201cThey are for those who believe, in this present world, but exclu-\nsively theirs on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d We \nthus detail the revelations for people who \nknow.  \n33. Say, \u201cMy Lord has forbidden immorali-\nties\u2014both open and secret \u2014and sin, and un-\njustified aggression, and that you associate \nwith Allah anything for which He reveal ed no \nsanction, and that you say about Allah what \nyou do not know.\u201d  \n34. For every nation is an appointed time. \nWhen their time has come, they cannot delay \nit by one hour, nor can they advance it.  \n35. O Children of Adam! When messengers \nfrom among you come to you, relating to you \nMy revelations \u2014whoever practices piety and \nreforms \u2014upon them shall be no fear, nor \nshall they grieve.  \n36. But as for those who reject Our revelations, \nand are too proud to accept them \u2014these are \nthe inmates of the Fire, where they will re-\nmain forever.  \n37. Who does greater wrong than he who in-\nvents lies about Allah, or denies His revela-\ntions? These \u2014their share of the decree will \nreach them. Until, when Our envoys come to \nthem, to take their souls away, they will say, \n\u201cWhere are they wh om you used to pray to \nbesides Allah?\u201d They will say, \u201cThey have \nabandoned us,\u201d and they will testify against themselves that they were faithless.  \n38.

So We took vengeance on them, and \ndrowned them in the sea \u2014because they re-\njected Our signs, and paid no heed to them.  \n137. And We mad e the oppressed people in-\nherit the eastern and western parts of the \nland, which We had blessed. Thus the fair \npromise of your Lord to the Children of Israel \nwas fulfilled, because of their endurance. And \nWe destroyed what Pharaoh and his people \nhad built, and what they had harvested.  \n138. And We delivered the Children of Israel \nacross the sea. And when they came upon a \npeople who were devoted to some statues of \ntheirs, they said, \u201cO Moses, make for us a god, \nas they have gods.\u201d He said, \u201cYou are truly an \nignorant people.\u201d  \n139. \u201cWhat these people are concerned with is \nperdition, and their deeds are based on false-\nhoods.\u201d  140. He said, \u201cShall I seek for you a god other \nthan Allah, when He has favored you over all \nother people?\u201d  \n141. Remember how We saved you fr om Phar-\naoh\u2019s people, who subjected you to the worst \nof sufferings \u2014killing your sons and sparing \nyour women. In that was a tremendous trial \nfrom your Lord.  \n142. And We appointed to Moses thirty nights, \nand completed them with ten; and thus the \ntime appointe d by his Lord was forty nights. \nAnd Moses said to his brother Aaron: \u201cTake \nmy place among my people, and be upright, \nand do not follow the way of the mischief -\nmakers.\u201d  \n143. And when Moses came to Our appoint-\nment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \n\u201cMy Lor d, allow me to look and see You.\u201d He \nsaid, \u201cYou will not see Me, but look at the \nmountain; if it stays in its place, you will see \nMe.\u201d But when his Lord manifested Himself \nto the mountain, He turned it into dust, and \nMoses fell down unconscious. Then, when he \nrecovered, he said, \u201cGlory be to you, I repent \nto you, and I am the first of the believers.\u201d  \n144. He said, \u201cO Moses, I have chosen you over \nall people for My messages and for My \nWords. So take what I have given you, and be \none of the thankful.\u201d  \n145. And We inscribed for him in the Tablets \nall kinds of enlightenments, and decisive ex-\nplanation of all things. \u201cHold fast to them, \nand exhort your people to adopt the best of \nthem. I will show you the fate of the sinners.\u201d  \n146. I will turn away from My revelat ions those \nwho behave proudly on earth without justifi-\ncation. Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it; and if they see the path of \nrectitude, they will not adopt it for a path; and \nif they see the path of error, they will adopt it \nfor a path. That is because they denied Our \nrevelations, and paid no attention to them.  \n147.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3640, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3af982d0-597e-488b-889b-138a31fd7c8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3af982d0-597e-488b-889b-138a31fd7c8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9aa91cb-fe0a-433a-8a83-205b6949f513", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "d27042f919a5437dda32d36fa7d9c648b5d49c467d2c1fd1a2e204a7134299fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6e03621-44e0-4e88-9478-c3185a4c85d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "2b2bd626b2d1399b3306af2aa8d57b80c5c155aa91673acc280c78a006aee3a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "12408828-9f2c-4923-a3ea-187affe8e9e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "99c5327d0e4ab5064d5d50924d94ff6d3e3b10194cabc0a29ef5bf09f1a2eeff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a9f1ee025765250ca43a0897ee04f09ee3ba6dea29662fee479fbcc73d42c7d5", "text": "So take what I have given you, and be \none of the thankful.\u201d  \n145.

THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A\u2019raf)  \n148. In his  absence, the people of Moses \nadopted a calf made from their ornaments \u2014\na body which lowed. Did they not see that it \ncould not speak to them, nor guide them in \nany way? They took it for worship. They were \nin the wrong.  \n149. Then, when they regretted, and re alized \nthat they had erred, they said, \u201cUnless our \nLord extends His mercy to us, and forgives \nus, we will be among the losers.\u201d  \n150. And when Moses returned to his people, \nangry and disappointed, he said, \u201cWhat an \nawful thing you did in my absence. Did you  \nforsake the commandments of your Lord so \nhastily?\u201d And he threw down the tablets; and \nhe took hold of his brother\u2019s head, dragging \nhim towards himself. He said, \u201cSon of my \nmother, the people have overpowered me, and were about to kill me; so do not allow the \nenemies to gloat over me, and do not count \nme among the unjust people.\u201d  \n151. He said, \u201cMy Lord, forgive me and my \nbrother, and admit us into Your mercy; for \nyou are the Most Merciful of the merciful.\u201d   \n152. Those who idolized the calf have incurred \nwrath from their Lord, and humiliation in \nthis life. We thus requite the innovators.  \n153. As for those who commit sins, and then \nrepent afterwards and believe \u2014your Lord, \nthereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.  \n154. When the anger abated in Moses, he took \nup the tablets. In their transcript is guidance \nand mercy for those in awe of their Lord.  \n155. And Moses chose from his people seventy \nmen for Our appointment. When the tremor \nshook them, he said, \u201cMy Lord, had You \nwilled, You could have destroyed them be-\nfore,  and me too. Will you destroy us for what \nthe fools among us have done? This is but \nYour test\u2014 with it You misguide whomever \nYou will, and guide whomever You will. You \nare our Protector, so forgive us, and have \nmercy on us. You are the Best of Forgivers.\u201d  \n156. \u201cAnd inscribe for us goodness in this \nworld, and in the Hereafter. We have turned to You.\u201d He said, \u201cMy punishment \u2014I inflict it upon whomever I will, but My mercy en-compasses all things. I will specify it for those \nwho act righteously and practice regu lar \ncharity, and those who believe in Our signs.\u201d  \n157.

But when they violated the \nSabbath, their fish would not come to them. \nThus We tried them  because they disobeyed.  \n164. And when a group of them said, \u201cWhy do \nyou counsel a people whom Allah will anni-\nhilate, or punish with a severe punishment?\u201d \nThey said, \u201cAs an excuse to your Lord, and so \nthat they may become righteous.\u201d  \n165. Then, when they neglected what they were \nreminded of, We saved those who prohibited \nevil, and We seized those who did wrong with \na terrible punishment, because of their sinful-\nness.  \n166. Then, when they rebelled against the com-\nmands to refrain, We said to them, \u201cBe des-\npicable apes.\u201d  \n167. Your Lord has announced that, He would \nsend against them, until the Day of Resurrec-\ntion, those who would inflict terrible suffer-\ning upon them.

And We tested them with fortunes and misfortunes, so that they may return.  \n169. They were succeeded by generations who \ninherited the Scripture and chose the materi-\nals of this  world, saying, \u201cWe will be for-\ngiven.\u201d And should similar materials come their way, they would again seize them. Did \nthey not make a covenant to uphold the \nScripture, and to not say about Allah except \nthe truth? Did they not study its contents? But the Hom e of the Hereafter is better for \nthe cautious; will you not understand?  \n170.

And when Your Lord summoned the de-\nscendants of Adam, and made them testify \nabout themselves. \u201cAm I not your Lord?\u201d \nThey said, \u201cYes, we testify.\u201d Thus you cannot \nsay on the Day of Resurrection, \u201cWe were un-\naware of this.\u201d  \n173. Nor can you Say, \u201cOur ancestors practiced \nidolatry before; and we are their descendants \nwho came after them; will you destroy us for \nwhat the fals ifiers did?\u201d  \n174.

And relate to them the story of him to \nwhom We delivered Our signs, but he de-\ntached himself from them, so Satan went af-\nter him, and he became one of the perverts.  \n176. Had W e willed, We could have elevated \nhim through them; but he clung to the \nground, and followed his desires. His meta-phor is that of a dog: if you chase it, it pants; \nand if you leave it alone, it pants. Such is the \nmetaphor of the people who deny Our signs. \nSo tell the tale, so that they may ponder.  \n177. Evil is the metaphor of the people who re-\nject Our signs and wrong themselves.  \n178. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. \nAnd whomever He sends astray \u2014these are \nthe losers.  \n179. We have destined for Hell mul titudes of \njinn and humans. They have hearts with \nwhich they do not understand. They have eyes with which they do not see. They have \nears with which they do not hear. These are \nlike cattle. In fact, they are further astray. \nThese are the heedless.  \n180. To Allah belong the Most Beautiful \nNames, so call Him by them, and disregard \nthose who blaspheme His names. They will \nbe repaid for what they used to do.  \n181. Among those We created is a commu-\nnity\u2014they guide by truth, and do justice \nthereby.  \n61", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3710, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2fdb948-49ba-40cb-8110-215e3af0898f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2fdb948-49ba-40cb-8110-215e3af0898f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "059db6ec-6394-46cd-a800-25ba88e8ead9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "52dbb72533bedbce4f3c0d30da2bc53a8f50dfa4f0bf6dd9ac09f6cf4bc22a43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6e03184-49a6-487c-8483-ac3cdbf3e19d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "a8517720e8b31308a77201138ff0af77592246e6412632aa3802cadfdba01702", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30e006e0-bb41-4674-ae93-5809734c106f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59f48e66ac55e98a988e71037d7b858cbd24ac615d2d1a1d1a7e4d1bbe049693", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8022cef64169d3787c459cb857af2ba11fbe395cb4fa073c59b6a5c47e5cba2a", "text": "7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A\u2019raf)  \n182. As for those  who reject Our messages, We \nwill gradually lead them from where they do \nnot know.  \n183. And I will encourage them. My plan is \nfirm.  \n184. Do they not think? There is no madness in \ntheir friend. He is but a plain warner.  \n185. Have they not observed the gover nment of \nthe heavens and the earth, and all the things that Allah created, and that their time may have drawn near? Which message, besides \nthis, will they believe in?  \n186. Whomever Allah misguides has no guide. \nAnd He leaves them blundering in their \ntransg ression.  \n187. They ask you about the Hour, \u201cWhen will \nit come?\u201d Say, \u201cKnowledge of it rests with my \nLord. None can reveal its coming except He. It weighs heavily on the heavens and the \nearth. It will not come upon you except sud-\ndenly.\u201d They ask you as if you are responsible \nfor it. Say, \u201cKnowledge of it rests with Allah,\u201d but most people do not know.  \n188. Say, \u201cI have no control over any benefit or \nharm to myself, except as Allah wills. Had I \nknown the future, I would have acquired \nmuch good, and no harm would have \ntouched me. I am only a warner, and a herald \nof good news to a people who believe.\u201d  \n189. It is He who created you from a single per-\nson, and made from it its mate, that he may \nfind comfort with her. Then, when he has covered her, she conceives a light load, and \nshe carries it around. But when she has grown heavy, they pray to Allah their Lord, \u201cif You \ngive us a good child, we will be among the \nthankful.\u201d  \n190. But when He has given them a good child, \nthey attribute partners to Him in what He has \ngiven them. Allah is exalted above what they \nassociate.  \n191. Do they idolize those who create nothing, \nand are themselves created?  \n192. And can neither help them, nor help their \nown selves?  193. And if you invite them to guidance, they \nwill not follow you. I t is the same for you, \nwhether you invite them, or remain silent.  \n194. Those you call upon besides Allah are \nservants like you. So call upon them, and let \nthem answer you, if you are truthful.  \n195. Do they have feet with which they walk? \nOr do they have ha nds with which they \nstrike? Or do they have eyes with which they \nsee? Or do they have ears with which they \nhear? Say, \u201cCall upon your partners, then plot \nagainst me, and do not wait.\u201d  \n196. \u201cMy Master is Allah, He Who sent down \nthe Book, and He takes care of the righteous.\u201d  \n197. Those you call upon besides Him cannot \nhelp you, nor can they help themselves.  \n198. And if you call them to guidance, they will \nnot hear. And you see them looking at you, yet they do not see.  \n199. Be tolerant, and command decency, an d \navoid the ignorant.  \n200. And when a suggestion from Satan assails \nyou, take refuge with Allah. He is Hearing and Knowing.  \n201. Those who are righteous \u2014when an im-\npulse from Satan strikes them, they remind themselves, and immediately see clearly.  \n202. But their brethren lead them relentlessly \ninto error, and they never stop short.  \n203. If you do not produce a miracle for them, \nthey say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you improvise one.\u201d \nSay, \u201cI only follow what is inspired to me from my Lord.\u201d These are insights from your \nLord , and guidance, and mercy, for a people \nwho believe.  \n204. When the Quran is recited, listen to it, and \npay attention, so that you may experience \nmercy.  \n205. And remember your Lord within yourself, \nhumbly and fearfully, and quietly, in the morning and the e vening, and do not be of \nthe neglectful.  \n206. Those who are in the presence of your \nLord are not too proud to worship Him.

THE SPOILS   (al-Anfal)  \nmatter. But Allah saved the situation. He \nknows what the hearts contain.  \n44. When you met, He made them appear as \nfew in your eyes, and made you appear fewer \nin their eyes, so that Allah may conclude a \npred etermined matter. To Allah all matters \nrevert.  \n45. O you who believe! When you meet a force, \nstand firm, and remember Allah much, so \nthat you may prevail.  \n46. And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do \nnot dispute, lest you falter and lose your \ncourage. And be steadfast. Allah is with the \nsteadfast.  \n47. And do not be like those who left their \nhomes boastfully, showing off before the peo-\nple, and barring others from the path of Al-\nlah. Allah comprehends what they do.  \n48. Satan made their deeds appear good to \nthem, and said, \u201cYou cannot be defeated by \nany people today, and I am at your side.\u201d But \nwhen the two armies came in sight of one an-\nother, he turned on his heels, and said, \u201cI am \ninnocent of you; I see what you do not see; I \nfear Allah; Allah is severe in punishment.\u201d  \n49. The hypocrites and those in whose hearts \nis sickness said, \u201cTheir religion has deluded \nthese people.\u201d But whoever puts his trust in \nAllah \u2014Allah is Mighty and Wise.  \n50. If only you could see, as the angels take \naway those who disbelieve, strik ing their \nfaces and their backs: \u201cTaste the agony of the Burning.\u201d  \n51. \u201cThat is because of what your hands have \ncommitted, and because Allah is not unjust to the servants.\u201d  \n52. Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, \nand those before them. They rejected the \nsigns of Allah, so Allah seized them for their \nsins. Allah is Powerful, Severe in punishment.  \n53. That is because Allah would never change \na blessing He has bestowed on a people unless \nthey change what is within themselves, and \nbecause Allah is Heari ng and Knowing.  54. Such was the case with the people of Phar-\naoh, and those before them. They denied the \nsigns of their Lord, so We annihilated them \nfor their wrongs, and We drowned the people \nof Pharaoh \u2014they were all evildoers.  \n55. The worst of creatures in Allah's view are \nthose who disbelieve. They have no faith.  \n56. Those of them with whom you made a \ntreaty, but they violate their agreement every \ntime. They are not righteous.  \n57. If you confront them in battle, make of \nthem a fearsome example for those who fol-\nlow them, that they may take heed.  \n58. If you fear treachery on the part of a people, \nbreak off with them in a like manner. Allah \ndoes not like the treacherous.  \n59. Let not the disbelievers assume that they \nare ahead. They will not escape.  \n60. And prepare against them all the power \nyou can muster, and all the cavalry you can \nmobilize, to terrify thereby Allah\u2019s enemies \nand your enemies, and others besides them \nwhom you do not know, but Allah knows \nthem. Whatever you spend in Allah\u2019s way will \nbe repa id to you in full, and you will not be \nwronged.  \n61. But if they incline towards peace, then in-\ncline towards it, and put your trust in Allah. \nHe is the Hearer, the Knower.  \n62. If they intend to deceive you \u2014Allah is suf-\nficient for you. It is He who supported  you \nwith His aid, and with the believers.  \n63. And He united their hearts. Had you spent \neverything on earth, you would not have \nunited their hearts, but Allah united them to-\ngether. He is Mighty and Wise.  \n64. O prophet! Count on Allah, and on the be-\nlievers  who have followed you.  \n65. O prophet! Rouse the believers to battle. If \nthere are twenty steadfast among you, they \nwill defeat two hundred; and if there are a \nhundred of you, they will defeat a thousand \nof those who disbelieve; because they are a \npeople w ho do not understand.  \n65", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3714, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc47a4a4-022c-4497-83a2-7224b8604ffc": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc47a4a4-022c-4497-83a2-7224b8604ffc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35f80e68-57b5-4ea9-9a5f-9e561cc411fd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "76627bd5b2882feb5be4d4dc73c6d1b3faeefcd615b5d99c263d8a9a4e137671", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29c54aa4-7773-4ece-b58c-00150dba41b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "e4db0b7d70b11dd74135e21094112c281ea2da04f40f39741532976ce35d39dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca506397-43e8-4439-bd74-3ea85d8b38ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3b91211ba4a7c532e47219a277813a849617360a5bdac01d3096104f9076616", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c5433b9048f67e0e38e3a2d70b24c43d0d7769618173b1edb4ca2c1abf694e79", "text": "9.

As for those who believed, but did not emigrate, you owe them no protec-tion, until they have emigrated.

As for those who disbelieve, they are allies \nof one another. Unless you do this, there will \nbe turmoil in the land, and much corruption.  \n74. Those who believed, and emigrated, and \nstruggled for Allah\u2019s cause, and those who gave shelter and support \u2014these are the true \nbelievers. They will have forgiveness, and a \nbountiful provision.  75. As for those who believed afterwards, and \nemigrated and struggled with you \u2014these be-\nlong with you.

A declaration of immunity from Allah and \nHis Messenger to the polytheists with whom \nyou had made a treaty.  \n2. So travel the land for four months, and \nknow that you cannot escape Allah, and that \nAllah will disgrace the disbelievers.  \n3. And a proclamation from Allah and His \nMessenger to the people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that Allah has disowned \nthe polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If \nyou repent, it will be better for you. But if you \nturn away, know that you cann ot escape Al-\nlah. And announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.  \n4. Except for those among the polytheists with \nwhom you had made a treaty, and did not vi-\nolate any of its terms, nor aided anyone \nagainst you. So fulfill the treaty with them to \nthe end of its term. Allah loves the righteous.  \n5. When the Sacred Months have passed, kill \nthe polytheists wherever you find them. And \ncapture them, and besiege them, and lie in \nwait for them at every ambush. But if they re-\npent, and perform the prayers, and  pay the \nalms, then let them go their way. Allah is \nMost Forgiving, Most Merciful.  \n6. And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for \nprotection, give him protection so that he \nmay hear the Word of Allah; then escort him \nto his place of safety. That is becau se they are \na people who do not know.  \n7. How can there be a treaty with the polythe-\nists on the part of Allah and His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they \nare upright with you, be upright with them. \nAllah loves the pious.  \n66", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3727, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca506397-43e8-4439-bd74-3ea85d8b38ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca506397-43e8-4439-bd74-3ea85d8b38ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "28b99b89-f2c2-4645-8ab1-15c1e9387e8c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "1e61f914a7675cac153bd05b50cdf87e294060f2372be74e28b278eb26021afd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc47a4a4-022c-4497-83a2-7224b8604ffc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "c5433b9048f67e0e38e3a2d70b24c43d0d7769618173b1edb4ca2c1abf694e79", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9cdd07a8-69eb-44d6-9c99-c0fb2fe4f012", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "26bbbca3cb84dedd616061e3e644c82395830764b537baa5f77ba51ecdd456c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a3b91211ba4a7c532e47219a277813a849617360a5bdac01d3096104f9076616", "text": "9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  \n8. How? Whenever they overcome you, they \nrespect neither kinship nor treaty with you. \nThey satisfy you with lip service, but their \nhearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.  \n9. They traded away Allah's revelations for a \ncheap price,  so they barred others from His \npath. How evil is what they did.  \n10. Towards a believer they respect neither \nkinship nor treaty. These are the transgres-sors.  \n11. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, \nand give the obligatory charity, then they are \nyour brethren in faith.

But if they violate their oaths after their \npledge, and attack your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief \u2014they have no faith\u2014\nso that they may desist.  \n13. Will you not fight a people who violated \ntheir oaths, and planned to exile the Messen-ger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do you fear them?

Allah will punish them at your \nhands, and humiliate them, and  help you \nagainst them, and heal the hearts of a believ-\ning people.  \n15. And He will remove the anger of their \nhearts.

The only people to attend Allah\u2019s places of \nworship are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice \nregular charity, and fear none but Allah. \nThese are most likely to be guided.  19. Do you consider giving water to pilgrims \nand maintaining the Sacred Mosque the same \nas believing in Allah and the Last Day and \nstriving in Allah\u2019s path?

Those w ho believe, and emigrate, and \nstrive in Allah\u2019s path with their possessions \nand their persons, are of a higher rank with \nAllah. These are the winners.  \n21. Their Lord announces to them good news \nof mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gar-\ndens wherein they will have lasting bliss.  \n22. Abiding therein forever. With Allah is a \ngreat reward.  \n23. O you who believe! Do not ally yourselves \nwith your parents and your siblings if they \nprefer disbelief to belief.

Then Allah sent down His serenity upon \nHis Messenger, and upon the believers; and \nHe sent down troops you did not see; and He punished those who disbelieved.

Fight those who do not believe in Allah, \nnor in the Last Day, nor forbid what Allah \nand His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide \nby the religion o f truth\u2014 from among those \nwho received the Scripture \u2014until they pay \nthe due tax, willingly or unwillingly.  \n30. The Jews said, \u201cEzra is the son of Allah,\u201d \nand the Christians said, \u201cThe Messiah is the \nson of Allah.\u201d These are their statements, out \nof their mouths. They emulate the statements \nof those who blasphemed before. May Allah \nassail them! How deceived they are!  \n31. They have taken their rabbis and their \npriests as lords instead of Allah, as well as the \nMessiah son of Mary. Although they were \ncommanded t o worship none but The One \nGod. There is no god except He. Glory be to \nHim; High above what they associate with \nHim.  \n32. They want to extinguish Allah\u2019s light with \ntheir mouths, but Allah refuses except to \ncomplete His light, even though the disbe-lievers d islike it.  \n33. It is He who sent His Messenger with the \nguidance and the religion of truth, in order to \nmake it prevail over all religions, even though \nthe idolaters dislike it.  \n34. O you who believe! Many of the rabbis and \npriests consume people's wealth illicitly, and \nhinder from Allah\u2019s path. Those who hoard \ngold and silver, and do not spend them in Al-\nlah\u2019s cause, inform them of a painful punish-\nment.  \n35. On the Day when they will be heated in the \nFire of Hell, then their foreheads, and their \nsides, and t heir backs will be branded with \nthem: \u201cThis is what you hoarded for your-\nselves; so taste what you used to hoard.\u201d  \n36. The number of months, according to Al-\nlah, is twelve months \u2014in the decree of Al-\nlah\u2014since the Day He created the heavens \nand the earth, of w hich four are sacred. This \nis the correct religion. So do not wrong your-\nselves during them. And fight the polytheists collectively, as they fight you collectively, and \nknow that Allah is with the righteous.  \n37. Postponement is an increase in disbelief \u2014\nby which those who disbelieve are led astray. \nThey allow it one year, and forbid it another \nyear, in order to conform to the number \nmade sacred by Allah, thus permitting what \nAllah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds seems good to them. Allah does not guid e the \ndisbelieving people.  \n38. O you who believe! What is the matter with \nyou, when it is said to you, \u201cMobilize in the \ncause of Allah,\u201d you cling heavily to the \nearth? Do you prefer the present life to the \nHereafter? The enjoyment of the present life, \ncom pared to the Hereafter, is only a little.  \n39. Unless you mobilize, He will punish you \nmost painfully, and will replace you with an-\nother people, and you will not harm Him at \nall. Allah has power over all things.  \n40. If you do not help him, Allah has already  \nhelped him, when those who disbelieved ex-\npelled him, and he was the second of two in the cave.

Their hearts are full of doubts, so they waver in \ntheir doubts.  \n46. Had they wanted to mobilize, they would \nhave made preparations for it; but Allah dis-\nliked their participation, so he held them \nback, and it was said, \u201cStay behind with those \nwho stay behind.\u201d  \n47. Had they mobilized with you, they would \nhave added only to your difficulties, and they \nwould have spread rumors in your midst, try-\ning to sow discord among you.

What prevents the acceptance of their con-\ntributions is nothing but the fact that they \ndisbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and that they do not approach the prayer except \nlazily, and that they do not spend except \ngrudgingly.  \n55. Let neither their possessions nor their chil-\ndren impress you. Allah intends to torment them through them in this worldly life, and \nthat their souls depart while they are disbe-\nlievers.  \n56.

Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or \ndo not ask forgiveness for them \u2014even if you \nask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them. That is because they \ndisbelieved in Allah and His Mes senger. Al-\nlah does not guide the immoral people.  \n81. Those who stayed behind rejoiced at their \nstaying behind the Messenger of Allah.

REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  \nprepared for them Gardens beneath which \nrivers flow, where they will abide forever. \nThat is the sublime triumph.  \n101. Among the Desert -Arabs around you \nthere are some hypocri tes, and among the in-\nhabitants of Medina too. They have become \nadamant in hypocrisy. You do not know \nthem, but We know them. We will punish \nthem twice; then they will be returned to a se-vere torment.  \n102. Others have confessed their sins, having \nmixed good  deeds with bad deeds. Perhaps \nAllah will redeem them. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  \n103. Receive contributions from their wealth, \nto purify them and sanctify them with it; and \npray for them. Your prayer is comfort for \nthem. Allah is Hearing and Knowing . \n104.

Allah will see your work, and \nso will His Messenger, and the bel ievers. \nThen you will be returned to the Knower of \nsecrets and declarations, and He will inform \nyou of what you used to do.\u201d  \n106. Others are held in suspense, awaiting Al-\nlah\u2019s decree, as to whether He will punish \nthem, or accept their repentance. Allah is \nAware and Wise.  \n107. Then there are those who establish a \nmosque to cause harm, and disbelief, and dis-\nunity among the believers, and as an outpost \nfor those who fight Allah and His Messenger. \nThey will swear: \u201cOur intentions are nothing \nbut good.\u201d But Alla h bears witness that they \nare liars.  \n108. Do not stand in it, ever. A mosque \nfounded upon piety from the first day is wor-\nthier of your standing in it. In it are men who \nlove to be purified. Allah loves those who pu-\nrify themselves.  \n109. Is he who founds his  structure upon piety \nand acceptance from Allah better, or he who \nfounds his structure on the brink of a cliff that is about to tumble, so it tumbles with \nhim into the Fire of Hell? Allah does not \nguide the unjust people.  \n110. The structure which they buil t will remain \nquestionable in their hearts, until their hearts \nare stopped. Allah is Knowing and Wise.  \n111. Allah has purchased from the believers \ntheir lives and their properties in exchange \nfor Paradise. They fight in Allah\u2019s way, and \nthey kill and get k illed. It is a promise binding \non Him in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Quran. And who is more true to his promise \nthan Allah? So rejoice in making such an ex-\nchange \u2014that is the supreme triumph.  \n112. Those who repent, those who worship, \nthose who praise , those who journey, those \nwho kneel, those who bow down, those who \nadvocate righteousness and forbid evil, and \nthose who keep Allah\u2019s limits \u2014give good \nnews to the believers.  \n113. It is not for the Prophet and those who be-\nlieve to ask forgiveness for the p olytheists, \neven if they are near relatives, after it has be-come clear to them that they are people of \nHellfire.  \n114. Abraham asked forgiveness for his father \nonly because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he \nwas an enem y of Allah, he disowned him. \nAbraham was kind and clement.  \n115.

To Allah belongs the domi nion of the \nheavens and the earth. He gives life, and He \ncauses death. And besides Allah, you have \nneither protector, nor supporter.  \n117. Allah has redeemed the Prophet, and the \nEmigrants, and the Supporters \u2014those who \nfollowed him in the hour of difficulty \u2014after \nthe hearts of some of them almost swerved. \nThen He pardoned them.

These \u2014their dwelling is the Fire\u2014 on ac-\ncount of what they used to do.  \n9. As for those who believe and do good deeds, \ntheir Lord guides them in their faith. Rivers \nwill flow beneath them in the Gardens of \nBliss.  \n10. Their call therein is, \u201cGlo ry be to You, our \nGod.\u201d And their greeting therein is, \u201cPeace.\u201d \nAnd the last of their call is, \u201cPraise be to Al-\nlah, Lord of the Worlds.\u201d  \n11. If Allah were to accelerate the ill for the \npeople, as they wish to accelerate the good, \ntheir term would have been  fulfilled. But We \nleave those who do not expect Our encounter \nto blunder in their excesses.  \n12. Whenever adversity touches the human \nbeing, he prays to Us \u2014reclining on his side, \nor sitting, or standing. But when We have re-\nlieved his adversity from him, he goes away, \nas though he had never called on Us for trou-\nble that had afflicted him. Thus the deeds of \nthe transgressors appear good to them.  \n13. We destroyed generations before you when \nthey did wrong. Their messengers came to \nthem with clear signs, but th ey would not be-\nlieve. Thus We requite the sinful people.  \n14. Then We made you successors on earth af-\nter them, to see how you would behave.  \n15.

I only follow what is revealed to \nme. I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the tor-\nment of a terrible Day.\u201d  \n16. Say, \u201cHad Allah willed, I would not have \nrecited it to you, and He wou ld not have \nmade it known to you. I have lived among you for a lifetime before it. Do you not un-\nderstand?\u201d  \n17. Who does greater wrong than someone \nwho fabricates lies about Allah, or denies His \nrevelations? The guilty will never prosper.  \n18. And they worship, besides Allah, what nei-\nther harms them nor benefits them. And they \nsay, \u201cThese are our intercessors with Allah.\u201d \nSay, \u201cAre you informing Allah about what He \ndoes not know in the heavens or on earth?\u201d \nGlorified be He, High above the associations \nthey ma ke. \n19.

Allah invites to the Home of Peace, and \nguides whomever He wills to a straight path.  \n26. For those who have done good is goodness, \nand more. Neither gloom n or shame will \ncome over their faces. These are the inhabit-\nants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.  \n27. As for those who have earned evil deeds: a \nreward of similar evil, and shame will cover \nthem. They will have no defense against Al-\nlah\u2014as if their faces  are covered with dark \npatches of night. These are the inmates of the \nFire, abiding therein forever.  \n28. On the Day when We will gather them al-\ntogether, then say to those who ascribed part-\nners, \u201cTo your place, you and your partners.\u201d Then We will separate between them, and \ntheir partners will say, \u201cIt was not us you were \nworshiping.\u201d  \n29. \u201cAllah is sufficient witness between us and \nyou.

And who governs the Or-\nder?\u201d They will say, \u201cAllah.\u201d Say, \u201cWill you \nnot be careful?\u201d  \n32. Such is Allah, your Lord \u2014the True. What \nis there, beyond the truth, except falsehood? \nHow are you turned away?  \n33. Thus your Lord\u2019s Word proved true \nagainst those who disobeyed, for they do not \nbelieve.  34.

Say, \u201cCan any of your partners guide to the \ntruth?\u201d Say, \u201cAllah guides to the truth. Is He \nwho guides to the truth more worthy of being \nfollowed, or he who does not guide, unless he \nhimself is guided? What is the matter with \nyou? How do you judge?\u201d  \n36. Most of them follow nothing but assump-\ntions; and  assumptions avail nothing against \nthe truth. Allah is fully aware of what they do.  \n37. This Quran could not have been produced \nby anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a confirmation of what preceded it, and an elaboration of the Book. There is no doubt \nabout it \u2014it is from the Lord of the Universe.  \n38. Or do they say, \u201cHe has forged it\u201d?

And among them are those who look at \nyou. But can you guide the blind, even \nthough they do not see?  \n44. Allah does not wrong the people in the \nleast, but the people wrong their own selves.  \n45.

You do not get into any situation, nor do \nyou recite any Quran, nor do you do any-\nthing, but We are watching over you as you \nundertake it. Not even the weight of an atom, \non earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor \nis there anything smaller or larger, but is in a \nclear  record.  \n62. Unquestionably, Allah\u2019s friends have noth-\ning to fear, nor shall they grieve.  \n63. Those who believe and are aware.  \n64. For them is good news in this life, and in \nthe Hereafter. There is no alteration to the \nwords of Allah. That is the supreme triumph.  \n65. And let not their sayings dishearten you. \nAll power is Allah\u2019s. He is the Hearer, the \nKnower.  \n66. Certainly, to Allah belongs everyone in the \nheavens and everyone on earth. Those who invoke other than Allah do not follow part-\nners; they follow o nly assumptions, and they \nonly guess.  \n67. It is He who made the night for your rest, \nand the daylight for visibility. Surely in that \nare signs for people who listen.  \n68. And they said, \u201cAllah has taken a son.\u201d Be \nHe glorified. He is the Self -Sufficient. His is \neverything in the heavens and everything on \nearth. Do you have any proof for this? Or are \nyou saying about Allah what you do not \nknow?  \n69.

So come to a deci-\nsion, you and your partners, and do not let \nthe matter perplex you; then carry out your \ndecision on me, and do not hold back.\u201d  \n72. \u201cBut if you turn away, I have not asked you \nfor any wage. My wage  falls only on Allah, \nand I was commanded to be of those who submit.\u201d  \n73. But they denounced him, so We saved him \nand those with him in the Ark, and We made \nthem successors, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs. So consider the fate of \nthose who wer e warned.  \n74. Then, after him, We sent messengers to \ntheir people. They came to them with the clear proofs, but they would not believe in an-\nything they had already rejected. Thus We set \na seal on the hearts of the hostile.  \n75. Then, after them, We sent Mos es and Aa-\nron with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his dig-\nnitaries. But they acted arrogantly. They were \nsinful people.  \n76. And when the truth came to them from Us, \nthey said, \u201cThis is clearly sorcery.\u201d  \n77. Moses said, \u201cIs this what you say of the \ntruth when it has come to you? Is this sor-cery? Sorcerers do not succeed.\u201d  \n78. They said, \u201cDid you come to us to divert us \nfrom what we found our ancestors following, \nand so that you become prominent in the \nland? We will never believe in you.\u201d  \n79. Pharaoh said, \u201cBring me  every experienced \nsorcerer.\u201d  \n80. And when the sorcerers came, Moses said \nto them, \u201cThrow whatever you have to throw.\u201d  81. And when they threw, Moses said, \u201cWhat \nyou produced is sorcery, and Allah will make \nit fail. Allah does not foster the efforts of the  \ncorrupt.\u201d  \n82. \u201cAnd Allah upholds the truth with His \nwords, even though the sinners detest it.\u201d  \n83. But none believed in Moses except some \nchildren of his people, for fear that Pharaoh \nand his chiefs would persecute them. Phar-\naoh was high and mighty in the  land. He was \na tyrant.  \n84. Moses said, \u201cO my people, if you have be-\nlieved in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if \nyou have submitted.\u201d  \n85. They said, \u201cIn Allah we have put our trust. \nOur Lord, do not make us victims of the op-pressive people.\u201d  \n86. \u201cAnd de liver us, by Your mercy, from the \ndisbelieving people.\u201d  \n87. And We inspired Moses and his brother, \n\u201cSettle your people in Egypt, and make your \nhomes places of worship, and perform the \nprayer, and give good news to the believers.\u201d  \n88. Moses said, \u201cOur Lord,  you have given \nPharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth \nin the worldly life. Our Lord, for them to lead away from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate \ntheir wealth, and harden their hearts, they \nwill not believe until they see the painful tor-\nment.\u201d  \n89. He sa id, \u201cYour prayer has been answered, \nso go straight, and do not follow the path of those who do not know.\u201d  \n90. And We delivered the Children of Israel \nacross the sea. Pharaoh and his troops pur-\nsued them, defiantly and aggressively. Until, \nwhen he was about to drown, he said, \u201cI be-\nlieve that there is no god except the One the \nChildren of Israel believe in, and I am of \nthose who submit.\u201d  \n91. Now?

Who does greater wrong than he who fab-\nricates lies about Allah? These will be pre-\nsented before their Lord, and t he witnesses \nwill say, \u201cThese are they who lied about their \nLord.\u201d Indeed, the curse of Allah is upon the \nwrongdoers.  \n19.

Some are still standing, \nand some have withered away.  \n101. We did not wrong them, but they wronged \nthemselves.

Remaining therein for as long as the heav-\nens and the earth endure, except as your Lord \nwills. Your Lord is Doer of whatever He wills.  \n108. And as for those who are happy, they will \nbe in Paradise, remaining therein for as long \nas the heavens and the earth endure, except \nas your Lord wills \u2014a reward without end.  \n109. So be not in doubt regarding what these \npeople worship. They worship only as their ancestors worshiped before. We will pay \nthem their due in full, without any reduction.  \n110. We gave Mo ses the Scripture, but it was \ndisputed. Were it not for a prior word from \nyour Lord, it would have been settled be-tween them. They are in serious doubt con-\ncerning it.  \n111. Your Lord will repay each one of them in \nfull for their deeds. He is Aware of everyt hing \nthey do.  \n112. So be upright, as you are commanded, \nalong with those who repented with you, and \ndo not transgress. He is Seeing of everything \nyou do.  \n113. And do not incline towards those who do \nwrong, or the Fire may touch you; and you \nwill have no pr otectors besides Allah, and \nyou will not be saved.  \n114. Perform the prayer at the borders of the \nday, and during the approaches of the night. The good deeds take away the bad deeds. This \nis a reminder for those who remember.  \n115. And be patient. Allah will  not waste the re-\nward of the virtuous.  \n116.

And when they entered into the presence \nof Joseph, he embraced his b rother, and said, \n\u201cI am your brother; do not be saddened by what they used to do.\u201d  \n70. Then, when he provided them with their \nprovisions, he placed the drinking -cup in his \nbrother\u2019s saddlebag. Then an announcer \ncalled out, \u201cO people of the caravan, you are  \nthieves.\u201d  \n71. They said, as they came towards them, \n\u201cWhat are you missing?\u201d  72. They said, \u201cWe are missing the king\u2019s gob-\nlet. Whoever brings it will have a camel -load; \nand I personally guarantee it.\u201d  \n73. They said, \u201cBy Allah, you know we did not \ncome to c ause trouble in the land, and we are \nnot thieves.\u201d  \n74. They said, \u201cWhat shall be his punishment, \nif you are lying?\u201d  \n75. They said, \u201cHis punishment, if it is found \nin his bag: he will belong to you. Thus we pe-\nnalize the guilty.\u201d  \n76. So he began with their b ags, before his \nbrother's bag. Then he pulled it out of his \nbrother\u2019s bag. Thus We devised a plan for Jo-seph; he could not have detained his brother \nunder the king\u2019s law, unless Allah so willed. \nWe elevate by degrees whomever We will; \nand above every perso n of knowledge, there \nis one more learned.  \n77. They said, \u201cIf he has stolen, a brother of his \nhas stolen before.\u201d But Joseph kept it to him-self, and did not reveal it to them. He said, \n\u201cYou are in a worse situation, and Allah is \nAware of what you allege.\u201d  \n78. They said, \u201cO noble prince, he has a father, \na very old man, so take one of us in his place. \nWe see that you are a good person.\u201d  \n79. He said, \u201cAllah forbid that we should arrest \nanyone except him in whose possession we \nfound our property; for then we w ould be un-\njust.\u201d  \n80. And when they despaired of him, they con-\nferred privately. Their eldest said, \u201cDon\u2019t you \nknow that your father received a pledge from \nyou before Allah, and in the past you failed \nwith regard to Joseph?

And He regulated the sun and \nthe moon, each running for a specified pe-\nriod. He manages all affairs, and He explai ns \nthe signs, that you may be certain of the meet-\ning with your Lord.  \n3.

In that are signs \nfor pe ople who reflect.  \n4.

Those are they who \nwill have yokes around their necks. Those are \nthe inhabitants of the Fire, where they will re-\nmain forever.  \n6. And they urge you to hasten evil before \ngood, though examples have passed away be-\nfore them. Your Lord is full of forgiveness to-wards the people for their wrongdoings, yet \nyour Lord is severe in retribution.  \n7. Those who disbelieve s ay, \u201cWhy was a mir-\nacle not sent down to him from his Lord?\u201d You are only a warner, and to every commu-\nnity is a guide.  \n8.

Yet they argue about Allah, while \nHe is  Tremendous in might.  \n14. To Him belongs the call to truth.

As for those who violate the promise to Al-\nlah, after pledging to keep it, and sever what \nAllah has commanded to be joined, and \nspread corruption on earth \u2014these, the curse \nwill be upon them, and they will have the Worst Home.  \n26.

Have  you not seen those who exchanged \nthe blessing of Allah with blasphemy, and \nlanded their people into the house of perdi-\ntion?  \n29. Hell\u2014they will roast in it. What a misera-\nble settlement.  \n30. And they set up rivals to Allah, in order to \nlead away from His path. Say, \u201cEnjoy your-selves; your destination is the Fire.\u201d  \n31. Tell My servants who have believed to per-\nform the prayers, and to give from what We \nhave given them, secretly and publicly, before \na Day comes in which there is neither trading \nnor friendship.  \n32. Allah is He Who created the heavens and \nthe earth, and sends down water from the \nsky, and with it produces fruits for your sus-tenance. And He committed the ships to your \nservice, sailing through the sea by His com-\nmand, and He committed the rivers to yo ur \nservice.  \n33. And He committed the sun and the moon \nto your service, both continuously pursuing their courses, and He committed the night \nand the day to your service.  \n34. And He has given you something of all \nwhat you asked. And if you were to count Al-\nlah\u2019s blessings, you would not be able to enu-\nmerate them. The human being is unfair and \nungrateful.  \n35.

So make the hearts of some people incline towards them, and pro-\nvide them with fruits, that they may be thank-\nful.\u201d  \n38. \u201cOur Lord, You know what we conceal and \nwhat we reveal. And nothing is hidden from \nAllah, on earth or in the heaven.\u201d  \n39. \u201cPraise be to Allah, Who has given me, in \nmy old age, Ishmael and Isaac. My Lord is the \nHearer of Prayers.\u201d  \n40. \u201cMy Lord, make me one who performs the \nprayer, and from my offspring.

Allah is Strong, \nAble to Avenge.  \n48. On the Day when the earth is changed into \nanother earth, and the heavens, and they will \nemerge before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.  \n49.

THE BEE   (an-Nahl)  \n60. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter \nset a bad example,  while Allah sets the High-\nest Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.  \n61. If Allah were to hold mankind for their in-\njustices, He would not leave upon it a single \ncreature, but He postpones them until an ap-\npointed time. Then, when their time arrives, \nthey will  not delay it by one hour, nor will \nthey advance it.  \n62. And they attribute to Allah what they \nthemselves dislike, while their tongues utter the lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a doubt, for them is the Fire, and they will be \nneglected.  \n63. By Alla h, We sent messengers to commu-\nnities before you, but Satan made their deeds appear alluring to them. He is their master \ntoday, and they will have a painful punish-\nment.  \n64. We revealed to you the Scripture only to \nclarify for them what they differ about, an d \nguidance and mercy for people who believe.  \n65. Allah sends down water from the sky, with \nwhich He revives the earth after its death. In \nthis is a sign for people who listen.  \n66. And there is a lesson for you in cattle: We \ngive you a drink from their bell ies, from be-\ntween waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing to the drinkers.  \n67. And from the fruits of date -palms and \ngrapevines, you derive sugar and wholesome \nfood. In this is a sign for people who under-\nstand.  \n68. And your Lord inspired the bee: \u201cSet up \nhives in the mountains, and in the trees, and \nin what they construct.\u201d  \n69. Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the \npathways of your Lord, with precision. From \ntheir bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors, \ncontaining healing for the people. Surely in \nthis is a sign for people who reflect.  \n70. Allah created you; then He takes you away. \nSome of you will be brought back to the worst age, so that he will no longer know anything, after having acquired knowledge. Allah is \nOmniscient and Omnipotent.  \n71. Allah  has favored some of you over others \nin livelihood. Those who are favored would \nnot give their properties to their servants, to \nthe extent of making them partners in it. Will they then renounce Allah\u2019s blessings?  \n72. Allah has given you mates from among \nyourselves; and has produced for you, from \nyour mates, children and grandchildren; and \nhas provided you with good things. Will they \nthen believe in falsehood, and refuse Allah\u2019s \nfavors?  \n73. And yet they serve besides Allah what pos-\nsesses no provisions for th em in the heavens, \nnor on earth, nor are they capable.  \n74. So do not cite the examples for Allah. Allah \nknows, and you do not know.  \n75. Allah cites the example of a bonded slave, \nwho has no power over anything; and some-\none to whom We have given plentiful p rovi-\nsion, from which he gives secretly and \nopenly. Are they equal in comparison? All \npraise belongs to Allah, but most of them do \nnot know.  \n76. And Allah cites the example of two men: \none of them dumb, unable to do anything, \nand is a burden on his master; whichever way \nhe directs him, he achieves nothing good. Is \nhe equal to him who commands justice, and \nis on a straight path?  \n77. To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens \nand the earth. The coming of the Hour is only \nas the twinkling of the eye, or even ne arer. Al-\nlah has power over everything.  \n78. Allah brought you out of your mothers\u2019 \nwombs, not knowing anything; and He gave you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the \nbrains; that you may give thanks.  \n79. Have they not seen the birds, flying in the \nmidst of  the sky? None sustains them except \nAllah. In this are signs for people who believe.  \n80.

But if \nyou resort to patience \u2014it is better for the pa-\ntient.  \n127. So be patient. Your patience is solely from \nAllah. And do not grieve over them, and do \nnot be stressed by their schemes.  \n128. Allah is with those who are righteous and \nthose who are virtuous.  \n  \n17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY  \n(al-Isra\u2019 ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. Glory to Him who journeyed His serv ant by \nnight, from the Sacred Mosque, to the Far-\nthest Mosque, whose precincts We have \nblessed, in order to show him of Our won-\nders. He is the Listener, the Beholder.  \n2. And We gave Moses the Scripture, and \nmade it a guide for the Children of Israel: Take none for protector other than Me.  \n3. The descendants of those We carried with \nNoah. He was an appreciative servant.  \n4. And We conveyed to the Children of Israel \nin the Scripture: You will commit evil on \nearth twice, and you will rise to a great height.  \n5. When the first of the two promises came \ntrue, We sent against you servants of Ours, \npossessing great might, and they ransacked \nyour homes. It was a promise fulfilled.  \n6. Then We gave you back your turn against \nthem, and supplied you with wealth and chil-\ndren, and made you more numerous.  \n7. If you work righteousness, you work right-\neousness for yourselves; and if you commit evil, you do so against yourselves. Then, \nwhen the second promise comes true, they \nwill make your faces filled with sorrow, and enter the Temple as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy all that falls into \ntheir power.  \n8. Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you. \nBut if you revert, We will revert. We have \nmade Hell a prison for the disbelievers.  \n9. This Quran guides to what is most upright; \nand it gives good news to the believers who \ndo good deeds, that they will have a great re-\nward.  \n10. And those who do not believe in the Here-\nafter \u2014We have prepared for them a painful \npunishment.  \n11. The human being prays for evil as he prays \nfor good. The human being is very hasty.  \n12. We have made the night and the day two \nwonders. We erased the wonder of the night, \nand made the wonder of the day revealing, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, \nand know the numbe r of years, and the cal-\nculation. We have explained all things in de-\ntail. \n13. For every person We have attached his fate \nto his neck. And on the Day of Resurrection, \nWe will bring out for him a book which he \nwill find spread open.  \n14. \u201cRead your book; today  there will be none \nbut yourself to call you to account.\u201d  \n15. Whoever is guided \u2014is guided for his own \ngood. And whoever goes astray \u2014goes astray \nto his detriment. No burdened soul carries \nthe burdens of another, nor do We ever pun-\nish until We have sent a me ssenger.  \n16. When We decide to destroy a town, We \ncommand its affluent ones, they transgress in \nit, so the word becomes justified against it, \nand We destroy it completely.  \n17. How many generations have We destroyed \nafter Noah? Your Lord is sufficient as \nKnower and Beholder of the sins of his serv-\nants.  \n18. Whoever desires the fleeting life, We expe-\ndite for him what We decide to give him, to whomever We desire. Then We consign him \n102", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3552, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c90004ab-6251-428b-9a9c-7843bbdff738": {"__data__": {"id_": "c90004ab-6251-428b-9a9c-7843bbdff738", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6bc39b50-d5bc-44bb-8176-1477f22295fd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "766940dcd05776a63936aab9d15c91f15987f269b55154f68d8a91060261fc52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7cf20062-4678-49a8-a8cb-0b5345f78562", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "bf2a85655f40aa0bf1e417016b9b57b9c7aaae92a9b2c0a6b596ae9ae18e8c58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4a2b7dd-a0bd-41ed-97c8-b661f5467d5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f36dbaa199036ead9e1cbacece5fdeceb94eee2c0ee461809539da8c6dce0897", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "76c32b4a3e431d846bb14f489fbf671030f4bc8a960b728ae259d6f13d408629", "text": "17.

To all \u2014these and those \u2014We extend from \nthe gifts of your Lord. The gifts of your Lord \nare not restricted.  \n21. See how We have favored s ome of them \nover others; yet the Hereafter is greater in \nranks, and greater in favors.  \n22. Do not set up another god with Allah, lest \nyou become condemned and damned.  \n23. Your Lord has commanded that you wor-\nship none but Him, and that you be good to \nyour p arents. If either of them or both of \nthem reach old age with you, do not say to \nthem a word of disrespect, nor scold them, \nbut say to them kind words.  \n24. And lower to them the wing of humility, \nout of mercy, and say, \u201cMy Lord, have mercy \non them, as they raised me when I was a \nchild.\u201d  \n25. Your Lord knows best what is in your \nminds. If you are righteous \u2014He is Forgiving \nto the obedient.  \n26. And give the relative his rights, and the \npoor, and the wayfarer, and do not squander \nwastefully.  \n27. The extravagant are brethren of the devils, \nand the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.  \n28. But if you turn away from them, seeking \nmercy from your Lord which you hope for, then say to them words of comfort.  \n29. And do not keep your hand tied to your \nneck, nor spread it out fully, lest you end up \nliable and regretful.  \n30. Your Lord expands the provision for \nwhomever He wills, and restricts it. He is \nfully Informed, Observant of His servants.  \n31. And do not kill your children for fear of \npoverty. We provide for them, and f or you. \nKilling them is a grave sin.  32. And do not come near adultery. It is im-\nmoral, and an evil way.  \n33. And do not kill the soul which Allah has \nmade sacred, except in the course of justice. \nIf someone is killed unjustly, We have given \nhis next of kin certain authority. But he \nshould not be excessive in killing, for he will \nbe supported.  \n34. And do not go near the orphan\u2019s property, \nexcept with the best of intentions, until he has \nreached his maturity. And honor your \npledge, because the pledge involves responsi-\nbility.  \n35. And give full measure when you measure, \nand weigh with accurate scales. That is fair, \nand the best determination.  \n36. And do not occupy yourself with what you \nhave no knowledge of. The hearing, and the \nsight, and the brains \u2014all these will be ques-\ntioned.  \n37. And do not walk proudly on earth. You can \nneither pierce the earth, nor can you match \nthe mountains in height.  \n38. The evil of all these is disliked by your \nLord.  \n39. That is some of the wisdom your Lord has \nrevealed to you. Do not set up with Allah an-\nother god, or else you will be thrown in Hell, \nrebuked and banished.  \n40. Has your Lord favored you with sons, \nwhile choosing for Himself daughters from \namong the angels? You are indeed saying a \nterrible thing.  \n41. We have explained in t his Quran in various \nways, that they may remember, but it only \nadds to their rebellion.  \n42. Say, \u201cIf there were other gods with Him, as \nthey say, they would have sought a way to the \nLord of the Throne.\u201d  \n43. Be He glorified. He is exalted, far above \nwhat th ey say.  \n44.

THE NIGHT JOURNEY   (al-Isra\u2019)  \nbut you do not understand their praises. He \nis indeed Forbearing and Forgiving.  \n45. When you read the Quran, We  place be-\ntween you and those who do not believe in \nthe Hereafter an invisible barrier.  \n46. And We drape veils over their hearts, pre-\nventing them from understanding it, and \nheaviness in their ears. And when you men-\ntion your Lord alone in the Quran, they tur n \ntheir backs in aversion.  \n47. We know well what they listen to, when \nthey listen to you, as they conspire, when the wrongdoers say, \u201cYou only follow a man be-\nwitched.\u201d  \n48. Note what they compared you to. They are \nlost, and unable to find a way.  \n49. And they say, \u201cWhen we have become \nbones and fragments, shall we really be resur-rected as a new creation?\u201d  \n50. Say, \u201cEven if you become rocks or iron.  \n51. Or some substance, which, in your minds, \nis even harder.\u201d Then they will say, \u201cWho will \nrestore us?\u201d Say,  \u201cThe One who originated \nyou the first time.\u201d Then they will nod their \nheads at you, and say, \u201cWhen will it be?\u201d Say, \n\u201cPerhaps it will be soon.\u201d  \n52. On the Day when He calls you, you will re-\nspond with His praise, and you will realize \nthat you stayed only a  little.  \n53. Tell My servants to say what is best. Satan \nsows discord among them. Satan is to man an \nopen enemy.  \n54. Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He \nwill have mercy on you; and if He wills, He \nwill punish you. We did not send you as their \nadvocate.  \n55. Your Lord knows well everyone in the \nheavens and the earth. We have given some \nprophets advantage over others; and to David \nWe gave the Psalms.  \n56. Say, \u201cCall upon those you claim besides \nHim. They have no power to relieve your ad-versity, nor can t hey change it.\u201d 57. Those they call upon are themselves seek-\ning means of access to their Lord, vying to be \nnearer, and hoping for His mercy, and fear-\ning His punishment. The punishment of your \nLord is to be dreaded.  \n58. There is no city but We will destroy before \nthe Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a \nsevere punishment. This is inscribed in the \nBook.  \n59. Nothing prevents Us from sending mirac-\nulous signs, except that the ancients called \nthem lies. We gave Thamood the she -camel, \na visible sign, but they mistreated her. We do \nnot send the signs except to instill reverence.  \n60. We said to you that your Lord encom-\npasses humanity. We did not make the vision We showed you, except as a test for the peo-\nple, and the tree cursed in the Quran. We \nfrighten them, but that only increases their \ndefiance.  \n61.

Or are you confident that He will not re-\nturn you to it once again, and unleash a hur-\nricane against you, and drown you for your \ningratitude? Then you will find no helper \nagainst Us.  \n70. We have honored the Children of Adam, \nand carried them on land and sea, and pro-\nvided them with good things, and greatly fa-\nvored them over many of those We created.  \n71. On the Day when We call every people with \ntheir leader. Whoever is given his record in \nhis right hand \u2014these will read their record, \nand they will not be wronged one bit.  \n72.

Had We not given y ou stability, you might \nhave inclined towards them a little.  \n75. Then We would have made you taste dou-\nble in life, and double at death; then you \nwould have found for yourself no helper \nagainst Us.  \n76. They almost provoked you, to expel you \nfrom the land. In that case, they would not have lasted after you, except briefly.  \n77. The tradition of the messengers We sent \nbefore you \u2014you will find no change in Our \nrules.  \n78.

And say, \u201cThe truth has come, and false-\nhood has withered away; for falsehood is \nbound to wither away.\u201d  \n82.

But when adver-\nsity touches him, he is in despair.  \n84. Say, \u201cEach does according to his disposi-\ntion. Your Lord knows best who is better \nguided in the way.\u201d  \n85. And they ask you about the Spirit. Say, \n\u201cThe Spirit belongs to the domain of my \nLord; and you were given only little \nknowledge.\u201d  \n86.

We have dis played for mankind in this \nQuran every kind of similitude, but most people insist on denying the truth.  \n90.

THE CAVE   (al-Kahf)  \n4. And to warn those who say, \u201cAllah has be-\ngotten a son.\u201d  \n5. They have no knowledge of this, nor did \ntheir forefathers. Grave is the word that \ncomes out of their mouths. They say nothing \nbut a lie.  \n6. Perhaps you may destroy yourself with \ngrief, chasing after them, if they do not be-lieve in this information.  \n7. We made what is upon the earth an orna-\nment for it, to test them as to which of them \nis best in conduct.  \n8. And We will turn what is on it into barren \nwaste.  \n9. Did you know that the People of the Cave \nand the Inscription were of Our wondrous signs?  \n10. When t he youths took shelter in the cave, \nthey said, \u201cOur Lord, give us mercy from \nYourself, and bless our affair with guidance.\u201d  \n11. Then We sealed their ears in the cave for a \nnumber of years.  \n12. Then We awakened them to know which \nof the two groups could better calculate the length of their stay.  \n13. We relate to you their story in truth. They \nwere youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.  \n14. And We strengthened their hearts, when \nthey stood up and said, \u201cOur Lord is the Lord \nof the heavens and the earth; we will not call \non any god besides Him, for then we would \nhave spoken an outrage.\u201d  \n15. \u201cThese people, our people, have taken to \nthemselves gods other than Him. Why do \nthey not bring a clear proof concerning them? Who, then, does greater wrong than he \nwho invents lies and attributes them to Al-\nlah?\u201d  \n16. \u201cNow that you have withdrawn from them, \nand from what they worship besides Allah, \ntake shelter in the cave. And your Lord will \nunfold His mercy for you, and will set your \naffair towards ease.\u201d  17. You would have seen the sun, when it rose, \nveering away from their cave towards the \nright, and when it sets, moving away from \nthem to the left, as they lay in the midst of the \ncave. That was one of Allah\u2019s wonders. He \nwhom Allah guides i s truly guided; but he \nwhom He misguides, for him you will find no \ndirecting friend.  \n18. You would think them awake, although \nthey were asleep. And We turned them over \nto the right, and to the left, with their dog stretching its paws across the threshold. Had \nyou looked at them, you would have turned \naway from them in flight, and been filled with \nfear of them.  \n19. Even so, We awakened them, so that they \nmay ask one another. A speaker among them \nsaid, \u201cHow long have you stayed?\u201d They said, \u201cWe have stayed a day, or part of a day.\u201d They \nsaid, \u201cYour Lord knows best how long you \nhave stayed.\u201d \u201cSend one of you to the city, \nwith this money of yours, and let him see \nwhich food is most suitable, and let him bring \nyou some provision thereof. And let him be \ngentle, an d let no one become aware of you.\u201d  \n20. \u201cIf they discover you, they will stone you, \nor force you back into their religion; then you \nwill never be saved.\u201d  \n21. So it was, that We caused them to be dis-\ncovered, that they would know that the \npromise of Allah is true, and that of the Hour \nthere is no doubt. As they were disputing \ntheir case among themselves, they said, \n\u201cBuild over them a building.\u201d Their Lord \nknows best about them. Those who prevailed \nover their case said, \u201cWe will set up over them \na place of wors hip.\u201d  \n22. They will say, \u201cThree, and their fourth be-\ning their dog.\u201d And they will say, \u201cFive, and \ntheir sixth being their dog,\u201d guessing at the \nunknown. And they will say, \u201cSeven, and \ntheir eighth being their dog.\u201d Say, \u201cMy Lord \nknows best their number.\u201d N one knows them \nexcept a few.

And ruin closed in on his crops, and so he \nbegan wringing his hands over what he had \ninvested in it, as it lays fallen upon its trellises. \nAnd he was saying, \u201cI wish I never associated \nanyone with my Lord.\u201d  \n43. He had  no faction to help him besides Al-\nlah, and he was helpless.  \n44. That is because authority belongs to Allah, \nthe True. He is Best in rewarding, and Best in requiting.  \n45.

THE CAVE   (al-Kahf)  \nbut then it becomes debris, scattered by the \nwind. Allah has absolute power over every-\nthing.  \n46. Wealth and children are the adornments of \nthe present life. But the things that last, the \nvirtuous deeds, are better with your Lord for \nreward, and better for hope.  \n47. On the Day when We set the mountains in \nmotion; and you see the earth emerging; and \nWe gather them together, and leave none of \nthem behind.  \n48. They will be presented before your Lord in \na row. \u201cYo u have come to Us as We created \nyou the first time. Although you claimed We would not set a meeting for you.\u201d  \n49. And the book will be placed, and you will \nsee the sinners fearful of its contents. And \nthey will say, \u201cWoe to us! What is with this \nbook that leaves nothing, small or big, but it \nhas enumerated it?\u201d They will find everything \nthey had done present. Your Lord does not \nwrong anyone.  \n50. We said to the angels, \u201cBow down to \nAdam.\u201d So they bowed down, except for Sa-\ntan. He was of the jinn, and he defied the \ncommand of his Lord. Will you take him and \nhis offspring as lords instead of Me, when \nthey are an enemy to you? Evil is the ex-\nchange for the wrongdoers.  \n51. I did not call them to witness the creation \nof the heavens and the earth, nor their own \ncreation; and I do not take the misleaders for \nassistants.  \n52. On the Day when He will say, \u201cCall on My \npartners whom you have claimed.\u201d They will call on them, but they will not answer them. \nAnd We will place between them a barrier.  \n53. And the sinners will s ee the Fire, and will \nrealize that they will tumble into it. They will \nfind no deliverance from it.  \n54. We have elaborated in this Quran for the \npeople every kind of example, but the human \nbeing is a most argumentative being.  \n55. What prevented people from  accepting \nfaith, when guidance has come to them, and from seeking their Lord\u2019s forgiveness? Unless \nthey are waiting for the precedent of the an-\ncients to befall them, or to have the punish-\nment come upon them face to face.  \n56. We send the messengers only as  deliverers \nof good news and warners. Those who disbe-\nlieve argue with false argument, in order to \ndefeat the truth thereby. They take My \nVerses, and the warnings, for a joke.  \n57. Who does greater wrong than he, who, \nwhen reminded of his Lord\u2019s revelations,  \nturns away from them, and forgets what his \nhands have put forward? We have placed \ncoverings over their hearts, lest they under-\nstand it, and heaviness in their ears. And if \nyou call them to guidance, they will not be \nguided, ever.  \n58. Your Lord is the Forg iver, Possessor of \nMercy. Were He to call them to account for \nwhat they have earned, He would have has-\ntened the punishment for them. But they \nhave an appointment from which they will \nfind no escape.  \n59. And these towns \u2014We destroyed them \nwhen they committed  injustices, and We set \nfor their destruction an appointed time.  \n60. Recall when Moses said to his servant, \u201cI \nwill not give up until I reach the junction of \nthe two rivers, even if it takes me years.\u201d  \n61. Then, when they reached the junction be-\ntween them,  they forgot about their fish. It \nfound its way into the river, slipping away.  \n62. When they went further, he said to his \nservant, \u201cBring us our lunch; we were ex-\nposed in our travel to much fatigue.\u201d  \n63. He said, \u201cDo you remember when we \nrested by the rock? I forgot about the fish. It \nwas only the devil who made me forget it. \nAnd so it found its way to the river, amaz-\ningly.\u201d  \n64. He said, \u201cThis is what we were seeking.\u201d \nAnd so they turned back retracing their steps.  \n65.

And he came out to his people, from the \nsanctuary, and signaled to them to p raise \nmorning and evening.  \n12. \u201cO John, hold on to the Scripture firmly,\u201d \nand We gave him wisdom in his youth.  \n13. And tenderness from Us, and innocence. \nHe was devout.  \n14. And kind to his parents; and he was not a \ndisobedient tyrant.  \n15. And peace be upon  him the day he was \nborn, and the day he dies, and the Day he is \nraised alive.  \n16. And mention in the Scripture Mary, when \nshe withdrew from her people to an eastern \nlocation.  \n17. She screened herself away from them, and \nWe sent to her Our spirit, and He a ppeared \nto her as an immaculate human.  \n18. She said, \u201cI take refuge from you in the \nMost Merciful, should you be righteous.\u201d  \n19. He said, \u201cI am only the messenger of your \nLord, to give you the gift of a pure son.\u201d  \n20. She said, \u201cHow can I have a son, when no \nman has touched me, and I was never un-chaste?\u201d  \n21. He said, \u201cThus said your Lord, `It is easy \nfor Me, and We will make him a sign for hu-manity, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter \nalready decided.'\u201c  \n22. So she carried him, and secluded herself \nwith him in a remote place.  \n23. The labor -pains came upon her, by the \ntrunk of a palm -tree. She said, \u201cI wish I had \ndied before this, and been completely forgot-\nten.\u201d  \n24. Whereupon he called her from beneath \nher: \u201cDo not worry; your Lord has placed a \nstream beneath you.  \n25. And shake the trunk of the palm -tree to-\nwards you, and it will drop ripe dates by you.\u201d  26. \u201cSo eat, and drink, and be consoled. And if \nyou see any human, say, \u2018I have vowed a fast \nto the Most Gracious, so I will not speak to \nany human today.'\u201c  \n27. Then she came to her people, carrying him. \nThey said, \u201cO Mary, you have done some-\nthing terrible.  \n28. O sister of Aaron, your father was not an \nevil man, and your mother was not a whore.\u201d  \n29. So she pointed to him. They said, \u201cHow \ncan we speak to an infant  in the crib?\u201d  \n30. He said, \u201cI am the servant of Allah. He has \ngiven me the Scripture, and made me a \nprophet.  \n31. And has made me blessed wherever I may \nbe; and has enjoined on me prayer and char-\nity, so long as I live.  \n32. And kind to my mother, and He did not \nmake me a disobedient rebel.  \n33. So Peace is upon me the day I was born, \nand the day I die, and the Day I get resur-rected alive.\u201d  \n34. That is Jesus son of Mary \u2014the Word of \ntruth about which they doubt.  \n35. It is not for Allah to have a child \u2014glory be \nto Him. To have anything done, He says to it, \u201cBe,\u201d and it becomes.  \n36. \u201cAllah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor-\nship Him. That is a straight path.\u201d  \n37. But the various factions differed among \nthemselves. So woe to those who disbelieve from the scene of a tr emendous Day.  \n38. Listen to them and watch for them the Day \nthey come to Us. But the wrongdoers today \nare completely lost.  \n39. And warn them of the Day of Regret, when \nthe matter will be concluded. Yet they are \nheedless, and they do not believe.  \n40. It is We who will inherit the earth and eve-\nryone on it, and to Us they will be returned.  \n41.

And mention in the Scripture Ishmael. He \nwas true to  his promise, and was a messenger, \na prophet.  \n55. And he used to enjoin on his people prayer \nand charity, and he was pleasing to his Lord.  \n56. And mention in the Scripture Enoch. He \nwas a man of truth, a prophet.  \n57.

TA-HA  (Ta-Ha) \n99. Thus We narrate to you reports of times \ngone by; and We have given you a message \nfrom Our Presence.  \n100. Whoever turns away from it will carry on \nthe Day of Resurrection a burden.  \n101. Abidi ng therein forever. And wretched is \ntheir burden on the Day of Resurrection.  \n102. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown \u2014\nWe will gather the sinners on that Day, blue.  \n103. Murmuring among themselves: \u201cYou have \nlingered only for ten.\u201d  \n104. We are fully aware of what they say, when \nthe most exemplary of them in conduct will \nsay, \u201cYou have lingered only a day.\u201d  \n105. And they ask you about the mountains. \nSay, \u201cMy Lord will crumble them utterly.\u201d  \n106. And leave them desolate waste.  \n107. You will see in them neithe r crookedness, \nnor deviation.\u201d  \n108. On that Day, they will follow the caller, \nwithout any deviation. Voices will be hushed \nbefore the Merciful, and you will hear noth-\ning but murmur.   \n109. On that Day, intercession will not avail, \nexcept for him permitted by the Merciful, and \nwhose words He has approved.  \n110. He knows what is before them and what is \nbehind them, and they cannot comprehend \nHim in their knowledge.  \n111. Faces will be humbled before the Living, \nthe Eternal. Whoever carries injustice will \ndespai r. \n112. But whoever has done righteous deeds, \nwhile being a believer \u2014will fear neither in-\njustice, nor grievance.  \n113. Thus We have revealed it an Arabic \nQuran, and We have diversified the warnings \nin it, that perhaps they would become right-\neous, or it may produce a lesson for them.  \n114. Exalted is Allah, the True King. Do not be \nhasty with the Quran before its inspiration to \nyou is concluded, and say, \u201cMy Lord, increase \nme in knowledge.\u201d  115. And We covenanted with Adam before, \nbut he forgot, and We found i n him no re-\nsolve.  \n116. And when We said to the angels, \u201cBow \ndown to Adam.\u201d They bowed down, except \nfor Satan; he refused.  \n117. We said, \u201cO Adam, this is an enemy to you \nand to your wife. So do not let him make you \nleave the Garden, for then you will suffer . \n118. In it you will never go hungry, nor be na-\nked. \n119. Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you \nswelter.\u201d  \n120. But Satan whispered to him. He said, \u201cO \nAdam, shall I show you the Tree of Immor-tality, and a kingdom that never decays?\u201d  \n121. And so they ate from it; whereupon their \nbodies became visible to them, and they \nstarted covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, \nand fell.  \n122. But then his Lord recalled him, and par-\ndoned him, and guided him.  \n123. He said, \u201cGo  down from it, altogether; \nsome of you enemies of some others. But \nwhenever guidance comes to you from Me, \nwhoever follows My guidance, will not go \nastray, nor suffer.  \n124. But whoever turns away from My Re-\nminder, for him is a confined life. And We \nwill ra ise him on the Day of Resurrection \nblind.\u201d  \n125. He will say, \u201cMy Lord, why did You raise \nme blind, though I was seeing?\u201d  \n126. He will say, \u201cJust as Our revelations came \nto you, and you forgot them, today you will \nbe forgotten.\u201d  \n127. Thus We recompense him who trans-\ngresses and does not believe in the revelations \nof his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter \nis more severe, and more lasting.  \n128.

This too is a blessed message that We re-\nvealed. Are you going to deny it?  \n51. We gave Abraham his integrity formerly, \nand We knew him well.  \n52. When he said to his father  and his people, \n\u201cWhat are these statues to which you are de-\nvoted?\u201d  \n53. They said, \u201cWe found our parents wor-\nshiping them.\u201d \n54.

They said, \u201cAre you the one who did this to \nour gods, O Abraham?\u201d  \n63. He said, \u201cBut it was this biggest of them \nthat did it. Ask them, if they can speak.\u201d  \n64. Then they turned to one another, and said, \n\u201cYou yourselves are the wrongdoers.\u201d  \n65. But they reverted to their old ideas: \u201cYou \ncertainly know that these do not speak.\u201d  66. He said, \u201cDo you worship, instead of Allah, \nwhat can neither benefit you in anything, nor \nharm you?  \n67. Fie on you, and on what you worship in-\nstead of Allah. Do you  not understand?\u201d  \n68. They said, \u201cBurn him and support your \ngods, if you are going to act.\u201d  \n69. We said, \u201cO fire, be coolness and safety \nupon Abraham.\u201d  \n70. They planned to harm him, but We made \nthem the worst losers.  \n71. And We delivered him, and Lot, to t he land \nthat We blessed for all people.  \n72. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a \ngift; and each We made righteous.  \n73. And We made them leaders, guiding by \nOur command; and We inspired them to do \ngood works, and to observe the prayer, and to \ngive out charity. They were devoted servants \nto Us.  \n74. And Lot\u2014 We gave him judgment and \nknowledge, and We delivered him from the \ntown that practiced the abominations. They \nwere wicked and perverted people.  \n75. And We admitted him into Our mercy; for \nHe was one of th e righteous.  \n76. And Noah, when he called before. So We \nanswered him, and delivered him and his \nfamily from the great disaster.  \n77. And We supported him against the people \nwho rejected Our signs. They were an evil \npeople, so We drowned them all.  \n78. And David and Solomon, when they gave \njudgment in the case of the field, when some people\u2019s sheep wandered therein by night; \nand We were witnesses to their judgment.  \n79. And so We made Solomon understand it, \nand to each We gave wisdom and knowledge. \nAnd We subje cted the mountains along with \nDavid to sing Our praises, and the birds as \nwell\u2014surely We did.  \n80.

THE PILGRIMAGE   (al-Hajj)  \n22. THE PILGRIMAGE  \n(al-Hajj) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. O people, be conscious of your Lord. The \nquaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing.  \n2. On the Day when you will see it: every nurs-\ning mother will discard her infant, and every \npregnant woman will abort her load, and you \nwill see the people drunk, even though they \nare not drunk \u2014but the punishment of Allah \nis severe.  \n3. Among the people is he who argues about \nAllah without knowledge, and f ollows every \ndefiant devil.  \n4. It was decreed for him, that whoever follows \nhim\u2014he will misguide him, and lead him to \nthe torment of the Blaze.  \n5. O people! If you are in doubt about the Res-\nurrection \u2014We created you from dust, then \nfrom a small drop, then f rom a clinging clot, \nthen from a lump of flesh, partly developed and partly undeveloped. In order to clarify \nthings for you. And We settle in the wombs \nwhatever We will for a designated term, and \nthen We bring you out as infants, until you \nreach your full strength. And some of you will \npass away, and some of you will be returned \nto the vilest age, so that he may not know, af-\nter having known. And you see the earth still; \nbut when We send down water on it, it vi-\nbrates, and swells, and grows all kinds of \nlovel y pairs.  \n6. That is because Allah is the truth, and be-\ncause He gives life to the dead, and because \nHe is Capable of everything.  \n7. And because the Hour is coming \u2014there is \nno doubt about it\u2014 and because Allah will \nresurrect those in the graves.  \n8. And among the people is he who argues \nabout Allah without knowledge, or guidance, \nor an enlightening scripture.  9. Turning aside in contempt, to lead away \nfrom the path of Allah. He will have humilia-\ntion in this world, and on the Day of Resur-\nrection We will make him  taste the agony of \nburning.  \n10. That is for what your hands have advanced, \nand because Allah is not unjust to the serv-\nants.  \n11. And among the people is he who worships \nAllah on edge. When something good comes \nhis way, he is content with it. But when an or-\ndeal strikes him, he makes a turnaround. He \nloses this world and the next. That is the ob-\nvious loss.  \n12. He invokes, instead of Allah, what can nei-\nther harm him nor benefit him. That is the far \nstraying.  \n13. He invokes one whose harm is closer than \nhis b enefit. What a miserable master. What a \nmiserable companion.  \n14. Allah will admit those who believe and do \nrighteous deeds into Gardens beneath which \nrivers flow. Allah does whatever He wills.  \n15. Whoever thinks that Allah will not help \nhim in this life an d in the Hereafter \u2014let him \nturn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cun-\nning eliminates what enrages him.  \n16. Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and \nAllah guides whomever He wills.  \n17. Those who believe, and those who are Jew-\nish, and the Sabeans, and the Christians, and \nthe Zoroastrians, and the Polytheists \u2014Allah \nwill judge between them on the Day of Res-\nurrection. Allah is witness to all things.  \n18. Do you not realize that to Allah prostrates \neveryone in the heavens and everyone on \nearth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and \nthe animals, and many of the people?

THE PILGRIMAGE   (al-Hajj)  \n41. Those who, when We empower them in the \nland, observe the prayer, and give regular \ncharity, and command what is right, and for-\nbid what is wrong. To Allah belongs the out-\ncome of events.  \n42. If they deny you\u2014 before them the people \nof Noah, and Aad, and Thamood also denied.  \n43. And the people of Abraham, and the peo-\nple of Lot.  \n44. And the inhabitants of Median. And Moses \nwas denied. Then I reprieved those who dis-\nbelieved, but then I seized them.  So how was \nMy rejection?  \n45. How many a town have We destroyed \nwhile it was doing wrong? They lie in ruins; \nwith stilled wells, and lofty mansions.  \n46. Have they not journeyed in the land, and \nhad minds to reason with, or ears to listen with? It is not the eyes that go blind, but it is \nthe hearts, within the chests, that go blind.  \n47. And they ask you to hasten the punish-\nment. But Allah never breaks His promise. A \nday with your Lord is like a thousand years of \nyour count.  \n48. How many a town have I repriev ed, alt-\nhough it was unjust? Then I seized it. To Me \nis the destination.  \n49. Say, \u201cO people, I am only a plain warner to \nyou.\u201d  \n50. Those who believe and work righteous-\nness\u2014for them is forgiveness and a generous \nprovision.  \n51. But those who strive against Ou r revela-\ntions \u2014these are the inmates of Hell.  \n52. We never sent a messenger before you, or \na prophet, but when he had a desire Satan in-\nterfered in his wishes. But Allah nullifies what \nSatan interjects, and Allah affirms His revela-\ntions. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.  \n53. In order to make Satan\u2019s suggestions a trial \nfor those whose hearts are diseased, and those \nwhose hearts are hardened. The wrongdoers \nare in profound discord.  54. And so that those endowed with \nknowledge may know that it is the truth from \nyour Lord, and so believe in it, and their \nhearts soften to it. Allah guides those who be-\nlieve to a straight path.  \n55. Those who disbelieve will continue to be \nhesitant about it, until the Hour comes upon \nthem suddenly, or there comes to them the \ntorment of a  desolate Day.  \n56. Sovereignty on that Day belongs to Allah; \nHe will judge between them. Those who be-\nlieve and do good deeds will be in the Gar-\ndens of Bliss.  \n57. But those who disbelieve and reject Our \nrevelations \u2014these will have a humiliating \npunishment.  \n58. Those who emigrate in Allah\u2019s cause, then \nget killed, or die, Allah will provide them with \nfine provisions. Allah is the Best of Providers.  \n59. He will admit them an admittance that will \nplease them. Allah is Knowing and Clement.  \n60. That is so! Whoeve r retaliates similarly to \nthe affliction he was made to suffer, and then \nhe is wronged again, Allah will definitely as-\nsist him. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.  \n61. That is because Allah merges the night into \nthe day, and He merges the day into the night,  \nand because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.  \n62. That is because Allah is the Reality, and \nwhat they invoke besides Him is vanity, and \nbecause Allah is the Sublime, the Grand.  \n63.

Allah is the Rich, the \nPraised.  \n65. Do you not see that Allah made everything \non earth subservient to you? How the ships sail at sea by His command? That H e holds \nup the sky lest it falls on earth \u2014except by His \npermission?

And on them, and on the ships, you are \ntransported.  \n23. We sent Noah to his people. He said, \u201cO \nmy people, worship Allah, you have no deity other than Him. Will you not take heed?\u201d  \n24. But the notables of his people, who disbe-\nlieved, said, \u201cThis is nothing but a human like you, who wants to gain superiority over you. \nHad Allah willed, He would have sent down \nangels. We never heard of this from our fore-\nfathers of old.  \n25. He is nothing but a man possessed. Just ig-\nnore him for a while.\u201d  \n26. He said, \u201cMy Lord, help me, for they have \nrejected me.\u201d  \n27. So We inspired him: \u201cBuild the Ark under \nOur observation and by Our inspiration. And \nwhen Our decree comes to pass, and the oven \nboils over, load into  it two pairs of every kind, \ntogether with your family, except those of \nthem against whom the word has already \nbeen pronounced. And do not speak to me \nconcerning those who did wrong; for they are to be drowned.\u201d  28. Then, when you and those with you are se t-\ntled in the Ark, say, \u201cPraise be to Allah, who has saved us from the wrongdoing people.\u201d  \n29. And say, \u201cMy Lord, land me with a blessed \nlanding, as you are the best of transporters.\u201d  \n30. Surely in that are signs. We are always test-\ning. \n31. Then, after them, We established another \ngeneration.  \n32. And We sent among them a messenger \nfrom themselves: \u201cServe Allah. You have no \ngod other than Him. Will you not be cau-\ntious?\u201d  \n33. But the dignitaries of his people, those who \ndisbelieved and denied the meeting of  the \nHereafter, and We had indulged them in the \npresent life, said, \u201cThis is nothing but a hu-\nman like you; he eats what you eat, and he \ndrinks what you drink.  \n34. If you obey a human being like yourselves, \nthen you will be losers.  \n35. Does he promise you t hat when you have \ndied and become dust and bones, you will be \nbrought out?  \n36. Farfetched, farfetched is what you are \npromised.  \n37. There is nothing but our life in this world. \nWe die, and we live, and we are not resur-rected.  \n38. He is nothing but a man, m aking up lies \nabout Allah. We have no faith in him.\u201d  \n39. He said, \u201cMy Lord, help me, for they have \nrejected me.\u201d  \n40. He said, \u201cSoon they will be filled with re-\ngret.\u201d  \n41. Then the Blast struck them, justifiably, and \nWe turned them into scum. So away with the wicked people.  \n42. Then, after them, We raised other genera-\ntions.  \n43. No nation can advance its time, nor can \nthey postpone it.  \n127", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3185, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7aab1c44-7265-4337-a8c6-e2bebc0dfc8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7aab1c44-7265-4337-a8c6-e2bebc0dfc8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "139", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57023a2e-fa3d-4fce-a9fa-a5aaa6812e3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "139", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "ff5ccfc10eeec89d145fed92afcc403174aa3bbe7aeaf2aca84be72a15357407", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dfdc284-2eca-4eb2-a3c8-24454b35921f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "6d75fbd6211f71b99c8caee1dcbae955ac46bfe264fb0c1dba797e50e6e1d46c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4758a305-2824-4e82-bd35-4741db3cd6bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca98597d01ab78531a72002e699a8c12e086c58594a640f8e7c9a110e9f761b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b372cc447867554f4087aea5efa56a2ee1a380c1ede97db5faf751f8d147c92a", "text": "23.

And We gave Moses the Scripture, that \nthey may be guided.  \n50.

It is they who race towards goodness. It is \nthey who will reach it first.  62. We never burden any soul beyond its ca-\npacity. And with Us is a record that tells the truth, and they will not be wronged.  \n63. But their heart s are puzzled because of this; \nand they have deeds that do not conform to \nthis, which they continue to perpetrate.  \n64.

My Verses were recited to you, but you \nturned back on your heels.  \n67. Arrogant towards it\u2014 talked nonsense \nabout it \u2014disregarded it.  \n68. Have they not pondered the Word? Or has \nthere come to them what came not to their \nforefathers of old?  \n69. Or is it t hat they did not recognize their \nmessenger, so they are denying him?  \n70. Or do they say, \u201cHe is possessed?\u201d In fact, \nhe brought them the truth, but most of them hate the truth.  \n71.

But those who do not believe in the Here-\nafter are swerving from the path.  \n75. Even if We had mercy on them, and re-\nlieved their problems, they would still blindly persist in their defiance.  \n76.

The adulteress and the adulterer \u2014whip \neach one of them a hundred lashes, and let no pity towards them overcome you regarding \nAllah\u2019s Law, if you believe in Allah and the \nLast Day. And let a group of believers witnes s \ntheir punishment.  \n3. The adulterer shall marry none but an adul-\nteress or an idolatress; and the adulteress \nshall marry none but an adulterer or an idol-ater. That has been prohibited for the believ-\ners. \n4. Those who accuse chaste women, then can-\nnot bring f our witnesses, whip them eighty \nlashes, and do not ever accept their testi-\nmony. For these are the immoral.  \n5. Except for those who repent afterwards, and \nreform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  6. As for those who accuse their own spouses, \nbut have no  witnesses except themselves, the \ntestimony of one of them is equivalent to four testimonies, if he swears by Allah that he is \ntruthful.  \n7. And the fifth time, that Allah\u2019s curse be \nupon him, if he is a liar.  \n8. But punishment shall be averted from her, \nif she swears four times by Allah, that he is a \nliar. \n9. And the fifth time, that Allah\u2019s wrath be \nupon her, if he is truthful.  \n10. Were it not for Allah\u2019s grace upon you, and \nHis mercy, and that Allah is Conciliatory and \nWise.  \n11. Those who perpetrated the slander are a \nband of you. Do not consider it bad for you, \nbut it is good for you. Each person among them bears his share in the sin. As for him \nwho played the major role \u2014for him is a ter-\nrible punishment.  \n12. Why, when you heard about it, the believ-\ning men  and women did not think well of one \nanother, and say, \u201cThis is an obvious lie\u201d?  \n13. Why did they not bring four witnesses to \ntestify to it? If they fail to bring the witnesses, \nthen in Allah\u2019s sight, they are liars.  \n14. Were it not for Allah\u2019s favor upon you, and \nHis mercy, in this world and the Hereafter, \nyou would have suffered a great punishment \nfor what you have ventured into.  \n15. When you rumored it with your tongues, \nand spoke with your mouths what you had no \nknowledge of, and you considered it trivi al; \nbut according to Allah, it is serious.  \n16.

The believers are those who believe in Al-\nlah and His Messenger, and when they are \nwith him for a matter of common interest, \nthey do not leave until they have asked him \nfor permission. Those who ask your permis-\nsion are those  who believe in Allah and His \nMessenger. So when they ask your permis-\nsion to attend to some affair of theirs, give \npermission to any of them you wish, and ask \nAllah\u2019s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiv-\ning and Merciful.  \n63. Do not address the Messenger i n the same \nmanner you address one another. Allah \nknows those of you who slip away using flimsy excuses.

And they say, \u201cTales of the ancients; he \nwrote them down; they are dictated to him \nmorning and evening.\u201d  \n6. Say, \u201cIt was revealed by He who knows the \nSecret in the heavens and the earth. He is al-\nways Forgiving and Merciful.\u201d  \n7. And they say, \u201cWhat sort of messenger is \nthis, who eats food, and walks in the market-\nplaces? If only an angel was sent down with \nhim, to be alongside  him a warner.\u201d  \n8. Or, \u201cIf only a treasure was dropped on \nhim.\u201d Or, \u201cIf only he had a garden from \nwhich he eats.\u201d The evildoers also say, \u201cYou \nare following but a man under spell.\u201d  \n9. Look how they invent examples for you. \nThey have gone astray, and cannot  find a \nway.  \n10. Blessed is He who, if He wills, can provide \nyou with better than that\u2014 gardens beneath \nwhich rivers flow \u2014and He will give you pal-\naces.  \n11. In fact, they have denied the Hour, and We \nhave prepared for those who deny the Hour a \nBlaze.  \n12. Whe n it sees them from a distant place, \nthey will hear it raging and roaring.  \n13. And when they are thrown into it, into a \ntight place, shackled, they will plead there for \ndeath.  \n14. \u201cDo not plead for one death today, but \nplead for a great many deaths.\u201d  \n15. Say, \u201cIs this better, or the Garden of Eter-\nnity promised to the righteous? It is for them \na reward and a destination.  \n16. They will have therein whatever they de-\nsire, forever. That is upon your Lord a bind-\ning promise.  \n17. On the Day when He gathers them, and \nwhat they worshiped besides Allah, He will say, \u201cWas it you who misled these servants of Mine, or was it they who lost the way?\u201d  \n18. They will say, \u201cGlory be to You. It was not \nfor us to take any lords besides You. But you \ngave them enjoyments, and their  ancestors, \nuntil they forgot the Message, and became ru-\nined people.\u201d  \n19. They have denied you because of what you \nsay; so you can neither avert, nor help. Who-\never among you commits injustice, We will \nmake him taste a grievous punishment.  \n20. We never sent  any messengers before you, \nbut they ate food and walked in the market-\nplaces. And We made some of you tempters \nfor one another \u2014will you be patient? Your \nLord is always Observing.  \n21. Those who do not expect to meet Us say, \n\u201cIf only the angels were sent dow n to us, or \nwe could see our Lord.\u201d They have grown ar-\nrogant within themselves, and have become \nexcessively defiant.  \n22. On the Day when they see the angels \u2014\nthere will be no good news for sinners on that \nDay; and they will say, \u201cA protective refuge.\u201d  \n23. We will proceed to the works they did, and \nwill turn them into scattered dust.  \n24. The companions of Paradise on that Day \nwill be better lodged, and more fairly accom-\nmodated.  \n25. The Day when the sky is cleft with clouds, \nand the angels are sent down in str eams.  \n26. On that Day, true sovereignty will belong \nto the Merciful, and it will be a difficult Day for the disbelievers.  \n27. On that Day, the wrongdoer will bite his \nhands, and say, \u201cIf only I had followed the \nway with the Messenger.  \n28. Oh, woe to me; I wish I never took so -and-\nso for a friend.  \n29. He led me away from the Message after it \nhad come to me; for Satan has always been a betrayer of man.\u201d  \n30. And the Messenger will say, \u201cMy Lord, my \npeople have abandoned this Quran.\u201d  \n134", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3496, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ecf11b9-5b68-4b55-b42e-9444ca361c42": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ecf11b9-5b68-4b55-b42e-9444ca361c42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d095c5d7-85b0-4298-a3cd-a87a661b1bfb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "f7f9ac19d4e21ef41255b8bd42e9f5bf52191cc961ca81ca8d1defda5a21641a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8e5c480-fcdc-46c6-91e5-d6b9c43323b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "c8de9e0c1b6ab74a18635fcb8b95f78df32cae238f8bc14851e76be5a20634a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c06f9ee-12fb-4bdf-b76f-8dffdd23a6b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8458825d3306cc84ad43fbef31e04ae38519af3761b7f06b092de5c09485ad99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c1eae0d35552edcd2c3c41e0eb2b2c94e2d79c7a9c6487faddede99c2e65ceac", "text": "25.  THE CRITERION   (al-Furqan)  \n31. Likewise, to every prophet We assign ene-\nmies from among the wicked. But your Lord \nsuffices as a Guide and Savior.  \n32. Those who disbelieve say, \u201cWhy was the \nQuran not revealed to him at once?\u201d Thus in \norder to strengthen your heart thereby, and \nWe revealed it in stages.  \n33. Whatever argument they come to you \nwith, We provide you with the truth, and a \nbetter exposition.  \n34. Those who are herded into Hell on their \nfaces \u2014those are in a worse position, and fur-\nther astray from the way.  \n35. We gave Moses the Scripture, and ap-\npointe d his brother Aaron as his assistant.  \n36. We said, \u201cGo to the people who rejected \nOur signs,\u201d and We destroyed them com-pletely.  \n37. And the people of Noah: when they re-\njected the messengers, We drowned them, \nand made them a lesson for mankind. We \nhave prep ared for the wrongdoers a painful \nretribution.  \n38. And Aad, and Thamood, and the inhabit-\nants of Arras, and many generations in be-\ntween.  \n39. To each We presented the parables; and \neach We devastated utterly.  \n40. And they came upon the city that was \ndrenched  by the terrible rain. Did they not \nsee it? But they do not expect resurrection.  \n41. And when they see you, they take you for \nnothing but mockery: \u201cIs this the one Allah \nsent as a messenger?\u201d  \n42. \u201cHe nearly led us away from our gods, had \nwe not patiently adhered to them.\u201d But they will know, when they witness the torment, \nwho is further away from the way.  \n43. Have you seen him who chose his desire as \nhis god? Would you be an agent for him?  \n44. Or do you assume that most of them hear \nor understand? They are just like cattle, but \neven more errant in their way.  45. Do you not see how your Lord extends the \nshadow? Had He willed, He could have made \nit still. And We made the sun a pointer to it.  \n46. Then We withdraw it towards Us gradu-\nally. \n47. And it is He who ma de the night a covering \nfor you, and sleep for rest; and He made the \nday a revival.  \n48. And it is He who sends the winds, bringing \nadvance news of His mercy; and We send \ndown from the sky pure water.  \n49.

We have circulated it among them, that \nthey may reflect, but most people persist in \nthanklessness.  \n51. Had We willed, We could have sent to \nevery town a warner.  \n52. So do not obey the disbelievers, but strive \nagainst them with it, a mighty struggle.  \n53. And it is He who merged the two seas; this \none fresh and sweet, and that one salty and \nbitter; and He placed between them a barrier, \nand an impassable boundary.  \n54. And it is He who, from fluid, created the \nhuman being. Then He made relationships \nthrough marriage and mating. Your Lord is \nOmnipotent.  \n55. And yet, instead of Allah, they serve what \nneither profits them nor harms them. The \ndisbeliever has always turned his back on his \nLord.  \n56.

We narrate to you from the history of Mo-\nses and Pharaoh \u2014in truth\u2014 for people who \nbelieve.  \n4. Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and di-\nvided its people into faction s. He persecuted \na group of them, slaughtering their sons, \nwhile sparing their daughters. He was truly a \ncorrupter.  \n5. But We desired to favor those who were op-\npressed in the land, and to make them lead-\ners, and to make them the inheritors.  \n6. And to establ ish them in the land; and to \nshow Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops, the \nvery thing they feared.  7. We inspired the mother of Moses: \u201cNurse \nhim; then, when you fear for him, cast him \ninto the river, and do not fear, nor grieve; We \nwill return him to you, and make him one of \nthe messengers.\u201d  \n8. Pharaoh\u2019s household picked him up, to be \nan opponent and a sorrow for them. Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops were sinners.  \n9. Pharaoh\u2019s wife said, \u201cAn eye's delight for me \nand for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he will \nbe useful to us, or we may adopt him as a \nson.\u201d But they did not foresee.  \n10. The heart of Moses\u2019 mother became vacant. \nShe was about to disclose him, had We not \nsteadied her heart, that she may remain a be-\nliever.  \n11. She said to his sister, \u201cTrail hi m.\u201d So she \nwatched him from afar, and they were una-\nware.  \n12. We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So \nshe said, \u201cShall I tell you about a family that can raise him for you, and will look after \nhim?\u201d  \n13. Thus We returned him to his mother, that \nshe may be comforted, and not grieve, and \nknow that Allah\u2019s promise is true. But most of them do not know.  \n14. And when he reached his maturity, and be-\ncame established, We gave him wisdom and \nknowledge. Thus do We reward the virtuous.  \n15. Once he entered the city, un noticed by its \npeople. He found in it two men fighting \u2014one \nof his own sect, and one from his enemies. \nThe one of his sect solicited his assistance \nagainst the one from his enemies; so Moses \npunched him, and put an end to him. He said, \n\u201cThis is of Satan's d oing; he is an enemy that \nopenly misleads.\u201d  \n16. He said, \u201cMy Lord, I have wronged myself, \nso forgive me.\u201d So He forgave him. He is the \nForgiver, the Merciful.  \n17. He said, \u201cMy Lord, in as much as you have \nfavored me, I will never be a supporter of the \ncrim inals.\u201d  \n145", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3285, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73f9fc14-b54e-4651-9289-3ae58794d6b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "73f9fc14-b54e-4651-9289-3ae58794d6b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6368d52-57ed-40c8-a8f6-1954aaf64e41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "99e75a31b9ab7c5db78459a64fa83c1c34e557b61c2ee3396d13655e273eebfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d0c9f1b-4631-4018-850b-9bbc3e6f0e1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "156", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "df884f706d4a3e1abd3644d5191558b2725d70d0a8a320f22eeeb248e0454f15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3480eaa-586d-46b6-9245-b8ae1ffffdc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "663077edda51870f7b3605d77fd9d50ddb7d5f01cd8b058096df111110444147", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c86c53cb0b63428a6f54b15c2c4c61acf085d5a52bf751367d0bfd5bef84fdf3", "text": "28.  HISTORY   (al-Qasas)  \n18. The next morning, he went about in the \ncity, fearful and vigilant, when the man who \nhad sought his assistance the day before was \nshouting out to him. Moses said to him, \u201cYou \nare clearly a troublemaker.\u201d  \n19. As he was about to strike the one who was \ntheir enemy, he said, \u201cO Moses, do you in-\ntend to kill me, as you killed someone yester-\nday? You only want to be a bully in the land, and do not want to be a peacemaker.\u201d  \n20. And a man came from the farthest part of \nthe city running. He said, \u201cO Moses, the au-\nthorities are considering killing you, so leave; I am giving you good advice.\u201d  \n21. So he left, fearful and vigilant. He said, \u201cMy \nLord, deliver me from the wrongdoing peo-\nple.\u201d  \n22. As he headed towards Median, he said, \n\u201cPerhaps my Lord will guide me t o the right \nway.\u201d  \n23. And when he arrived at the waters of Me-\ndian, he found there a crowd of people draw-\ning water, and he noticed two women waiting \non the side. He said, \u201cWhat is the matter with \nyou?\u201d They said, \u201cWe cannot draw water un-\ntil the shepherds de part, and our father is a \nvery old man.\u201d  \n24. So he drew water for them, and then with-\ndrew to the shade, and said, \u201cMy Lord, I am \nin dire need of whatever good you might send \ndown to me.\u201d  \n25. Then, one of the two women approached \nhim, walking bashfully. She  said, \u201cMy father \nis calling you, to reward you for drawing wa-\nter for us.\u201d And when he came to him, and \ntold him the story, he said, \u201cDo not fear, you \nhave escaped from the wrongdoing people.\u201d  \n26. One of the two women said, \u201cFather, hire \nhim; the best empl oyee for you is the strong \nand trustworthy.\u201d  \n27. He said, \u201cI want to marry you to one of \nthese two daughters of mine, provided you work for me for eight years. But if you com-plete ten, that is up to you. I do not intend to \nimpose any hardship on you. You w ill find \nme, Allah willing, one of the righteous.\u201d  28. He said, \u201cLet this be an agreement between \nyou and me. Whichever of the two terms I \nfulfill, there shall be no reprisal against me; \nand Allah is witness over what we say.\u201d  \n29. When Moses had completed the term, and \ndeparted with his family, he noticed a fire by \nthe side of the Mount. He said to his family, \n\u201cStay here, I have glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I \ncan bring you some information from there, \nor an ember from the fire, that you may warm \nyourselves.\u201d  \n30. When he reached it, he was called from the \nright side of the valley, at the Blessed Spot, \nfrom the bush: \u201cO Moses, it is I, Allah, the \nLord of the Worlds.  \n31. Throw down your staff.\u201d And when he saw \nit wiggling, as if it were possessed, he turned \nhis bac k to flee, and did not look back. \u201cO \nMoses, come forward, and do not fear, you \nare perfectly safe.  \n32. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it \nwill come out white, without blemish. And \npress your arm to your side, against fear. These are two proofs from y our Lord, to \nPharaoh and his dignitaries. They are truly \nsinful people.\u201d  \n33.

HISTORY   (al-Qasas)  \n38. Pharaoh said, \u201cO nobles, I know of no god \nfor you other than me. So fire -up the bricks \nfor me O Hamaan, and build me a tower, that \nI may ascend to the God of Moses, though I \nthink he is a liar.\u201d  \n39. He and his troops acted arrogantly in the \nland, with no justification. They thought they would not be returned to Us.  \n40. So We seized him, and his troops, and We \nthrew them into the sea. Observe, therefore, \nwhat was the end of the oppressors.  \n41. And We made them leaders calling to the \nFire. And on Resurrection Day, they will not \nbe saved.  \n42. And We pursued them in this world with a \ncurse. And on Resurrection Day, they will be among the despised.  \n43. We gave Moses the Scripture after We had \nannihi lated the previous generations; as an il-\nlumination for mankind, and guidance, and mercy, so that they may remember.  \n44. You were not on the Western Side when \nWe decreed the command to Moses, nor \nwere you among the witnesses.  \n45. But We established many gen erations, and \ntime took its toll on them. Nor were you among the people of Median, reciting Our \nrevelations to them. But We kept sending \nmessengers.  \n46. Nor were you by the side of the Mount \nwhen We proclaimed. Rather, it was a mercy \nfrom your Lord, that y ou may warn people \nwho received no warner before you, so that \nthey may take heed.  \n47. Otherwise, if a calamity befell them as a re-\nsult of what their hands have perpetrated, \nthey would say, \u201cOur Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have follo wed \nYour revelations, and been among the believ-\ners.\u201d  \n48. But when the truth came to them from Us, \nthey said, \u201cIf only he was given the like of \nwhat was given to Moses.\u201d Did they not dis-\nbelieve in what was given to Moses in the past? They said, \u201cTwo works o f magic back-\ning one another.\u201d And they said, \u201cWe are dis-believing in both.\u201d  \n49. Say, \u201cThen bring a scripture from Allah, \nmore conductive to guidance than both, and \nI will follow it, if you are truthful.\u201d  \n50. But if they fail to respond to you, know that \nthey follow their fancies. And who is more \nlost than him who follows his fancy without guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide \nthe unjust people.  \n51. We have delivered the Word to them, that \nthey may remember.  \n52. Those to whom We gave the Scripture be-\nfore it believe in it.  \n53. When it is recited to them, they say, \u201cWe \nhave believed in it; it is the truth from our \nLord; we were Muslims prior to it.\u201d  \n54. These will be given their reward twice, be-\ncause they persevered; and they counter evil \nwith good; and from Our provisions to them, \nthey give.  \n55. And when they hear vain talk, they avoid \nit, and say, \u201cWe have our deeds, and you have \nyour deeds; peace be upon you; we do not de-\nsire the ignorant.\u201d  \n56. You cannot guide whom you love, but Al-\nlah guides whom He wills, and He knows best \nthose who are guided.  \n57. And they say, \u201cIf we follow the guidance \nwith you, we will be snatched from our land.\u201d Did We not establish for them a Safe Sanctu-\nary, to which are brought all kinds of fruits, \nas provision from Ourselves? But most of \nthem do not know.  \n58. And how many a city did We destroy for \nturning unappreciative of its livelihood? Here \nare their homes, uninhabited after them, ex-cept for a few. And We became the Inheri-\ntors.  \n59. Your Lord never destroys cities without \nfirst sending a messenger in their midst, re-\nciting to them Our revelations. And We \nnever destroy the cities, unless their people \nare wrongdoers.  \n147", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3558, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "259aabe8-b27b-489b-b8e1-7a371f9cc1a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "259aabe8-b27b-489b-b8e1-7a371f9cc1a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1494a54-35b2-4a26-86b8-e052d9a25e86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "bde3a6bb7ceabb509e74fa4f37e16e31beda774c3640dcfffe91d3f190a315a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "59c55ad0-46cd-4d4e-809d-5cc8138e9d46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "5a1a9bfe6a749835b8c1a566c7d2141faeeb02fa894893e32860e87659a79e2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "32e24cb9-d94c-4b46-b18d-8243885b2081", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b96dab3c890a0e5828efa6369aff252e219e6cc6df5eb11013fb7434622359b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b93093089591e79cdc2e8b907de15285c86bfa0da9a6cd111dac0772ecb96c81", "text": "28.

On the Day when He will call to them, and \nsay, \u201cWhere are My associates whom you \nused to claim?\u201d  \n75.

He said, \u201cI was given all this on account of \nknowledge I possess.\u201d Did he not know that \nAllah destroyed many generations before \nhim, wh o were stronger than he, and pos-\nsessed greater riches? But the guilty will not be asked about their sins.  \n79. And he went out before his people in his \nsplendor. Those who desired the worldly life \nsaid, \u201cIf only we possessed the likes of what \nQuaroon was gi ven. He is indeed very fortu-\nnate.\u201d  \n80. But those who were given knowledge said, \n\u201cWoe to you! The reward of Allah is better for \nthose who believe and do righteous deeds.\u201d \nYet none attains it except the steadfast.  \n81.

We have advised the human being to be \ngood to his parents. But if they urge you to \nassociate with Me something you have no knowledge of, do not obey them. To Me is \nyour return; and I will inform you of what \nyou used to do.  \n9. Those who believe and do good works \u2014We \nwill admit them into the company of the \nrighteous.  \n10. Among the people is he who says, \u201cWe \nhave believed in Allah.\u201d Yet when he is harmed on Allah\u2019s account, he equates the \npeople's persecution with Allah\u2019s retribution. \nAnd if help comes from your Lord, he says, \n\u201cWe were actually with you.\u201d Is not Allah \naware of what is inside the hearts of the peo-\nple? \n11. Allah certainly knows those who believe, \nand He certainly knows the hypocrites.  \n12. Those who disbelieve say to those who be-\nlieve, \u201cFollow our way, and  we will carry your \nsins.\u201d In no way can they carry any of their sins. They are liars.  \n13. They will carry their own loads, and other \nloads with their own. And they will be ques-\ntioned on the Day of Resurrection concern-\ning what they used to fabricate.  \n14. We sent Noah to his people, and He stayed \namong them for a thousand years minus fifty \nyears. Then the Deluge swept them; for they \nwere wrongdoers.  \n15. But We saved him, together with the com-\npany of the Ark, and We made it a sign for all peoples.  \n149", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3384, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e6b29f6-2b1e-418a-bbe7-35d7cb9d2f53": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e6b29f6-2b1e-418a-bbe7-35d7cb9d2f53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e394b4a-e890-4bdd-a2e8-eb970e8e7dce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "99bf89a2a23cfd8bf10cd4b57302a32c45631aa1e28313017dcbbe83a6b07f9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "32e24cb9-d94c-4b46-b18d-8243885b2081", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "b96dab3c890a0e5828efa6369aff252e219e6cc6df5eb11013fb7434622359b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4fb324d-7782-44db-916d-a57b4cab5b42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3ec1dc2f4cb89e118d5c1a081ded981227ec42c05a10b915a592d2ee28681ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f9cf802bfbdeccbffc57884fb4cb1965442fe24fd954d92aa4eb13138af456f8", "text": "29.

So seek yo ur livelihood from Allah, \nand worship Him, and thank Him. To Him \nyou will be returned.\u201d  \n18. If you disbelieve, communities before you \nhave also disbelieved.

But the only response from his people was \ntheir saying, \u201cKill him, or burn him.\u201d But Al-\nlah saved him from the fire. Surely in that are \nsigns for people who believe.  \n25. And he said, \u201cYou have chosen idols in-\nstead  of Allah, out of affection for one an-\nother in the worldly life. But then, on the Day \nof Resurrection, you will disown one another, \nand curse one another. Your destiny is Hell, \nand you will have no saviors.\u201d  \n26.

And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and \nconferred on his descendants the \nProphethood and the Book, and gave him his reward in this life; and in the Hereafter he will \nbe among the upright.  \n28. And Lot, when he said to his people, \u201cYou \nare committing an obscenity not perpetrated \nbefore you by anyone in the whole world.  \n29. You approach men, and cut off the way, \nand commit lewdness in your gatherings.\u201d \nBut the only response from his people was to \nsay, \u201cBri ng upon us Allah\u2019s punishment, if \nyou are truthful.\u201d  \n30. He said, \u201cMy Lord, help me against the \npeople of corruption.\u201d  \n31. And when Our envoys brought Abraham \nthe good news, they said, \u201cWe are going to \ndestroy the people of this town; its people are \nwrongd oers.\u201d  \n32. He said, \u201cYet Lot is in it.\u201d They said, \u201cWe \nare well aware of who is in it. We will save \nhim, and his family, except for his wife, who \nwill remain behind.\u201d  \n33. Then, when Our envoys came to Lot, they \nwere mistreated, and he was troubled and \ndistressed on their account. They said, \u201cDo \nnot fear, nor grieve. We will save you and \nyour family, except for your wife, who will re-\nmain behind.\u201d  \n34. \u201cWe will bring down upon the people of \nthis town a scourge from heaven, because of \ntheir wickedness.\u201d  \n35.

THE ROMANS   (ar-Rum)  \n18. His is the praise in the heavens and on \nearth, and in the evening, and when you \nreach midday.  \n19. He brings the living out of the dead, and He \nbrings the dead out of the living, and He re-\nvives the land after it had died. Likewise you \nwill be resur rected.  \n20. And of His signs is that He created you \nfrom dust; and behold, you become humans \nspreading out.  \n21. And of His signs is that He created for you \nmates from among yourselves, so that you \nmay find tranquility in them; and He planted love and compa ssion between you. In this are \nsigns for people who reflect.  \n22. And of His signs is the creation of the heav-\nens and the earth, and the diversity of your \nlanguages and colors. In this are signs for \nthose who know.  \n23. And of His signs are your sleep by nig ht \nand day, and your pursuit of His bounty. In \nthis are signs for people who listen.  \n24. And of His signs is that He shows you the \nlightning, causing fear and hope. And He \nbrings down water from the sky, and with it He revives the earth after it was dead. In this \nare signs for people who understand.  \n25. And of His signs is that the heaven and the \nearth stand at His disposal. And then, when He calls you out of the earth, you will emerge \nat once.  \n26. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens \nand the earth. All a re submissive to Him.  \n27. It is He who initiates creation, and then re-\npeats it, something easy for Him. His is the \nhighest attribute, in the heavens and the \nearth. He is the Almighty, the Wise.  \n28. He illustrates an example for you, from \nyour own selves: d o you make your servants \nfull partners in the wealth We have given \nyou? Do you revere them as you revere one \nanother? We thus explain the revelations for \na people who understand.  \n29. Yet the wrongdoers follow their desires \nwithout knowledge. But who can gu ide whom Allah leaves astray? They will have no \nhelpers.  \n30. So devote yourself to the religion of mono-\ntheism \u2014the natural instinct Allah has in-\nstilled in mankind. There is no altering Al-\nlah\u2019s creation. This is the true religion, but most people do not know . \n31. Turning towards Him \u2014and be conscious \nof Him, and perform the prayer, and do not \nbe of the idolaters.  \n32. Of those who divided their religion, and \nbecame sects; each faction pleased with what they have.  \n33. When affliction touches the people, they \ncall on their Lord, turning to Him in repent-\nance. But then, when He gives them a taste of \nHis mercy, some of them attribute partners to \ntheir Lord.  \n34. To show ingratitude for what We have \ngiven them. Indulge yourselves \u2014you will \nsurely know.  \n35. Have We sent down to them any authority, \nwhich speaks in support of their idols?  \n36. When We give people a taste of mercy, they \nrejoice in it. But when adversity befalls them, \nbecause of what their hands have perpetrated, \nthey begin to despair.  \n37. Do they not see that Allah expands the pro-\nvision for whomever He wills, or restricts it? \nSurely in this are signs for people who be-\nlieve.  \n38. So give the relative his rights, and the des-\ntitute, and the wayfarer. That is best for those \nwho seek Allah\u2019s presence. Those are the \nprosperous.  \n39. The usury you practice, seeking thereby to \nmultiply people\u2019s wealth, will not multiply \nwith Allah. But what you give in charity, de-siring Allah\u2019s approval \u2014these are the multi-\npliers.  \n40. Allah is He who created you, then provides \nfor you, then makes you die, then brings you \nback to life. Can any of your idols do any of \nthat?

Corruption has appeared on land and sea, \nbecause of what people\u2019s hands have earned, \nin order to make them tas te some of what \nthey have done, so that they might return.  \n42. Say, \u201cRoam the earth, and observe the fate \nof those who came before. Most of them were \nidolaters.\u201d  \n43. So devote yourself to the upright religion, \nbefore there comes from Allah a Day that \ncanno t be averted. On that Day, they will be \nshocked.  \n44.

So that He may reward those who have be-\nlieved and done the righteous deeds out of \nHis bounty. Indeed, He does not love the un-\ngrateful.  \n46. And of His signs is that He sends the winds \nbearing good news, to give you a taste of His mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His command, and so that you may seek of His \nbounty, and so that you m ay give thanks.  \n47. Before you, We sent messengers to their \npeople. They came to them with clear proofs. Then We took revenge on those who sinned. \nIt is incumbent on Us to help the believers.  \n48. Allah is He who sends the winds. They stir \nup clouds. Then H e spreads them in the sky \nas He wills. And He breaks them apart. Then \nyou see rain drops issuing from their midst. \nThen, when He makes it fall upon whom He \nwills of His servants, behold, they rejoice.  \n49.

But if We send a wind, and they see it turn-\ning things yellow, they would continue there-\nafter to disbelieve.  \n52. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can \nyou make the deaf hear the call when they \nturn away.  53. Nor can you guide the blind out of their er-\nror. You can make hear only those who be-\nlieve in Our signs, and so have submitted.  \n54. Allah is He Who created you weak, then af-\nter weakness gave you strength, then after \nstrength gave you weakness and gray hair. He \ncreates whatever He wills. He is the Omnisci-\nent, the Omnipotent.  \n55. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the \nsinners will swear they had stayed but an \nhour. Thus they were deluded.  \n56. But those endowed with knowledge and \nfaith will say, \u201cYou remained in Allah\u2019s Book \nuntil the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day \nof Resurrection, but you did not know.\u201d  \n57.

That He subjected the sun and the \nmoon, each running for a stated term? And \nthat Allah is Cognizant of everything you do?  \n30. That is because Allah is the Reality, and \nwhat they worship besides Him is falsehood, \nand because Allah is the Exalted, the Su-\npreme.  \n31. Have you not seen how the ships sail \nthrough the sea, by the grace of Allah, to \nshow you of His wonders? In that are signs \nfor every persevering, thankful person.  \n32. When waves, like canopies, cover them, \nthey call upon Allah, devoting their religion \nto Him. But when He has delivered them to \ndry land, some of them waver. No one re-\nnounces Our revelat ions except the treacher-\nous blasphemer.  \n33. O people! Be conscious of your Lord, and \ndread a Day when no parent can avail his child, nor can a child avail his parent, in any-\nthing. The promise of Allah is true. There-\nfore, do not let this life deceive you, n or let \nillusions deceive you regarding Allah.  \n34. With Allah rests the knowledge of the \nHour. He sends down the rain, and He knows what the wombs contain. No soul knows \nwhat it will reap tomorrow, and no soul \nknows in what land it will die. Allah is All-\nKnowing, Well -Informed.  \n  \n32. PROSTRATION  \n(as-Sajdah ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  \n2. The revelation of the Book, without a doubt, \nis from the Lord of the Universe.  \n3. Yet they say, \u201cHe made it up.\u201d In fact, it is \nthe Truth from your Lord, to warn a people \nwho received no warner before you, that they \nmay be guided.  4. Allah is He who created the heavens and the \nearth and everything between them in six \ndays, and then established Himself on the \nThrone. Apart from Him, you  have no mas-\nter and no intercessor. Will you not reflect?  \n5. He regulates all affairs, from the heavens, to \nthe earth. Then it ascends to Him on a Day \nthe length of which is a thousand years by \nyour count.  \n6. That is the Knower of the Invisible and the \nVisible, the Powerful, the Merciful.   \n7. He who perfected everything He created, \nand originated the creation of man from clay.  \n8. Then made his reproduction from an ex-\ntract of an insignificant fluid.  \n9. Then He proportioned him, and breathed \ninto him of His Spirit. Then He gave you the \nhearing, and the eyesight, and the brains \u2014\nbut rarely do you give thanks.  \n10. And they say, \u201cWhen we are lost into the \nearth, shall we be in a new creation?\u201d In fact, \nthey deny the meeting with their Lord.  \n11. Say, \u201cThe angel of death put in charge of \nyou will reclaim you. Then to your Lord you \nwill be returned.\u201d  \n12. If only you could see the guilty, bowing \ntheir heads before their Lord: \u201cOur Lord, we \nhave seen and we have heard, so send us back, \nand we will act righteously; we ar e now con-\nvinced.\u201d  \n13. Had We willed, We could have given every \nsoul its guidance, but the declaration from Me will come true: \u201cI will fill Hell with jinn \nand humans, altogether.\u201d  \n14. So taste, because you forgot the meeting of \nthis Day of yours; We have forgotten you; so \ntaste the eternal torment for what you used to \ndo. \n15. They believe in Our communications, \nthose who, when reminded of them, fall \ndown prostrate, and glorify their Lord with \npraise, and are not proud.  \n16.

Allah is fully aware of what you do. \n3. And put your trust in Allah. Allah is enough \nas a trustee.  \n4. Allah did not place two hearts inside any \nman's body. Nor did He make your wives \nwhom you equate with your mothers, your actual mot hers. Nor did He make your \nadopted sons, your actual sons. These are your words coming out of your mouths. Al-\nlah speaks the truth, and guides to the path.  \n5. Call them after their fathers; that is more \nequitable with Allah. But if you do not know \ntheir fathers, then your brethren in faith and \nyour friends. There is no blame on you if you \nerr therein, barring what your hearts pre-\nmeditates. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  \n6. The Prophet is more caring of the believers \nthan they are of themselves, and his wives are \nmothers to them. And blood -relatives are \ncloser to one another in Allah\u2019s Book than the \nbelievers or the emigrants, though you \nshould do good to your friends. That is in-\nscribed in the Book.  \n7. Recall that We received a pledge from the \nprophets, a nd from you, and from Noah, and \nAbraham, and Moses, and Jesus son of Mary. We received from them a solemn pledge.  \n8. That He may ask the sincere about their sin-\ncerity. He has prepared for the disbelievers a \npainful punishment.  \n9. O you who believe!

When they came upon you, from above \nyou, and from beneath you; and the eyes be-\ncame dazed, and th e hearts reached the \nthroats, and you harbored doubts about Al-\nlah. \n11. There and then the believers were tested, \nand were shaken most severely.  \n12. When the hypocrites and those in whose \nhearts is sickness said, \u201cAllah and His Mes-\nsenger promised us nothing  but illusion.\u201d  \n13. And when a group of them said, \u201cO people \nof Yathrib, you cannot make a stand, so re-treat.\u201d And a faction of them asked the \nProphet to excuse them, saying, \u201cOur homes \nare exposed,\u201d although they were not ex-\nposed.

Say, \u201cFlight will not benefit you, if you flee \nfrom death or killing, even then you will be \ngiven only brief enjoyment.\u201d  \n17. Say, \u201cWho is it who will shield you from \nAllah, if He intends adversity for you, or in-\ntends mercy for you?\u201d Besides Allah, they will \nfind for themselves neither friend nor helper.  \n18. Allah already knows the hinderers among \nyou, and those who say to their brethren, \n\u201cCome and join us.\u201d Rarely do they mobilize \nfor battle.  \n19. Being stingy towards you. And when fear \napproaches, y ou see them staring at you \u2014\ntheir eyes rolling \u2014like someone fainting at \ndeath. Then, when panic is over, they whip \nyou with sharp tongues. They resent you any \ngood. These have never believed, so Allah has \nnullified their works; a matter easy for Allah.  \n20. They assumed that the confederates had \nnot withdrawn.

And if they were among you, they \nwould have done little fighting.  \n21. You have  an excellent example in the Mes-\nsenger of Allah; for anyone who seeks Allah \nand the Last Day, and remembers Allah fre-\nquently.  \n22. And when the believers saw the confeder-\nates, they said, \u201cThis is what Allah and His \nmessenger have promised us; and Allah and \nHis messenger have told the truth.\u201d And it \nonly increased them in faith and submission.  \n23. Of the believers are men who are true to \nwhat they pledged to Allah. Some of them \nhave fulfilled their vows; and some are still \nwaiting, and never wavering.  \n24. That Allah may reward the truthful for \ntheir truthfulness; and punish the hypocrites, \nif He wills, or pardon them. Allah is Forgiv-\ning and Merciful.  \n25. Allah repelled the disbelievers in their rage; \nthey gained no advantage. Allah thus spared \nthe believers co mbat. Allah is Strong and \nMighty.  \n26. And He brought down from their strong-\nholds those of the People of the Book who backed them, and He threw terror into their hearts. Some of them you killed, and others you took captive.  \n27. And He made you inherit their  land, and \ntheir homes, and their possessions, and a re-\ngion you have never stepped on. Allah has \npower over all things.  \n28. O Prophet! Say to your wives, \u201cIf you desire \nthe life of this world and its finery, then let me \ncompensate you, and release you kind ly. \n29. But if you desire Allah, His Messenger, and \nthe Home of the Hereafter, then Allah has \nprepared for the righteous among you a mag-\nnificent compensation.\u201d  \n30. O wives of the Prophet!

Allah desires to remove all impurity from you, O People of the Household, and to pu-\nrify you thoroughly.  \n34. And remember what is recited in your \nhomes of Allah's revelations a nd wisdom. Al-\nlah is Kind and Informed.  \n35. Muslim men and Muslim women, believ-\ning men and believing women, obedient men and obedient women, truthful men and truthful women, patient men and patient \nwomen, humble men and humble women, \ncharitable men and char itable women, fast-\ning men and fasting women, men who guard \ntheir chastity and women who guard, men \nwho remember Allah frequently and women \nwho remember \u2014Allah has prepared for \nthem a pardon, and an immense reward.  \n36. It is not for any believer, man or woma n, \nwhen Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, to have liberty of choice in their de-\ncision. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes-\nsenger has gone far astray.  \n37. When you said to him whom Allah had \nblessed, and you had favored, \u201cKeep your \nwife to yours elf, and fear Allah.\u201d But you hid \nwithin yourself what Allah was to reveal. And \nyou feared the people, but it was Allah you \nwere supposed to fear. Then, when Zaid \nended his relationship with her, We gave her \nto you in marriage, that there may be no re-\nstric tion for believers regarding the wives of \ntheir adopted sons, when their relationship has ended. The command of Allah was ful-\nfilled.  \n38. There is no blame on the Prophet regard-\ning what Allah has ordained for him. Such is \nthe pattern of Allah among those wh o passed \nbefore. The command of Allah is an absolute \ndecree.  \n39. Those who deliver the messages of Allah, \nand fear Him, and never fear anyone except \nAllah. Allah is sufficient as a reckoner.  \n40. Muhammad is not the father of any of your \nmen; but he is the Messenger of Allah, and \nthe seal of the prophets. Allah is Cognizant of \neverything.  \n41. O you who believe, remember Allah with \nfrequent remembrance.  \n42. And glorify Him morning and evening.  \n43. It is He who reaches out to you, and His \nangels, to bring you out of darkness into the \nlight. And He is Ever -Merciful towards the \nbelievers.  \n44. Their greeting on the Day they meet Him \nis, \u201cPeace,\u201d and He has prepared for them a generous reward.  \n45. O prophet! We have sent you as a witness, \nand a bearer of good news,  and a warner.  \n46. And a caller towards Allah by His leave, \nand an illuminating beacon.  \n47. And give the believers the good news that \nfor them is a great reward.  \n48. And do not obey the blasphemers and the \nhypocrites, and ignore their insults, and rely on Allah. Allah is a sufficient protector.  \n49. O you who believe! When you marry be-\nlieving women, but then divorce them before \nyou have touched them, there is no waiting \nperiod for you to observe in respect to them; \nbut compensate them, and release them in a  \ngraceful manner.  \n50. O Prophet! We have permitted to you your \nwives to whom you have given their dowries, and those you already have, as granted to you \nby Allah, and the daughters of your paternal \nuncle, and the daughters of your paternal \n159", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3685, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb2ada5b-71b0-4b2a-960d-cdb557c34b7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb2ada5b-71b0-4b2a-960d-cdb557c34b7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c628c35d-ef7c-4ea6-a16c-029f077e8f8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "3167f500388fc07037089391d4a496b232216a41708ef2f1c854b748a6417dbf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e044c3d1-e89e-4b7e-9249-d9c150669b14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "170", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "5a86c47a8c2ce6149887975b5a29f99cd979e279716cf0a0f22dfb3a3e97b365", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf850742-2655-4228-9a19-e33296fe9f7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc8c707598961cd5f165e2eea0e69b56c16e006cde26d959f2cee506d6844b35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fed37b39d575ab2b868578018930ce67a7bf6a1c52cf276acb9a2bd5cdf7e3e2", "text": "33.

But they turned away, so We unleashed \nagainst them the flood of the dam; and We \nsubstituted their two gardens with two gar-\ndens of bitter fruits, thorny shrubs, and mea-\nger harvest.  \n17. We thus penalized them for their ingrati-\ntude. Would We penalize any but the un-grateful?  \n18. Between them and the towns We had \nblessed, We placed prominent towns, and \nWe made the travel between them easy. \n\u201cTravel between them by night and day, in \nsafety.\u201d  \n19. But they said, \u201cOur Lord, lengthen the dis-\ntances of our journeys.\u201d They wronged them-\nselves; so We made them history, and We scattered them in every direction. In this are \nlessons for every steadfast and appreciative \nperson.  \n20. Satan was correct in his assessment of \nthem. They followed him, except for a group \nof believers.  \n21. He had no authority over them; except that \nWe willed to distinguish him who believes in the Hereaf ter, from him who is doubtful \nabout it. Your Lord is Guardian over all \nthings.  \n22.

Until, \nwhen fear has subsided from their hearts, they will say, \u201cWhat did your Lord say?\u201d They \nwill say, \u201cThe truth, and He is the High, the \nGreat.\u201d  \n24. Say, \u201cWho provides for you from the heav-\nens and the earth?\u201d Say, \u201cAllah. And Either \nyou, or we, are rightly guided, or in evident \nerror.\u201d  \n25.

He is the \nAll-Knowing Judge.\u201d  \n27. Say, \u201cShow me those you have attached to \nHim as associates. No indeed! But He is Al-\nlah, the Powerful, the Wise.\u201d  \n28. We sent you only universally to all people, \na heral d and warner, but most people do not \nknow.  \n29. And they say, \u201cWhen is this promise due, \nif you are truthful?\u201d  \n30. Say, \u201cYou are promised a Day, which you \ncannot postpone by one hour, nor bring for-\nward.\u201d  \n31. Those who disbelieve say, \u201cWe will never \nbelieve in this Quran, nor in what came be-\nfore it.\u201d If you could only see the wrongdoers, \ncaptive before their Lord, throwing back alle-\ngations at one another. Those who were op-\npressed will say to those who were arrogant, \n\u201cWere it not for you, we would have been be-\nlievers.\u201d  \n32. Those who were arrogant will say to those \nwho were oppressed, \u201cWas it us who turned \nyou away from guidance when it came to \nyou? No indeed, you yourselves were sinful.\u201d  \n33. And those who were oppressed will say to \nthose who were arrogant, \u201cIt was your \nscheming by night and day; as you instructed \nus to reject Allah, and to set up rivals to Him.\u201d \nThey will hide their remorse when they see \nthe retribution. We will put yokes around the \nnecks of those who disbelieved. Will they be \nrepaid for anything other than what they \nused to do?  \n34. We sent no warner to any town, without its \naffluent saying, \u201cWe reject what you are sent \nwith.\u201d  \n35. And they say, \u201cWe have more wealth and \nmore children, and we will not be punished.\u201d  \n36.

ORIGINATOR   (Fatir)  \n6. Satan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an \nenemy. He only  invites his gang to be among \nthe inmates of the Inferno.  \n7. Those who disbelieve will suffer a harsh \npunishment, but those who believe and do \nrighteous deeds will have forgiveness and a \ngreat reward.  \n8. What of him whose evil deed was made at-\ntractive to h im, and so he regards it as good? \nAllah leads astray whomever He wills, and He \nguides whomever He wills. Therefore, do not \nwaste yourself sorrowing over them. Allah \nknows exactly what they do.  \n9. Allah is He who sends the winds, which ag-\nitate clouds, which We drive to a dead land, \nand thereby revive the ground after it had \ndied. Likewise is the Resurrection.  \n10. Whoever desires honor \u2014all honor belongs \nto Allah. To Him ascends speech that is pure, \nand He elevates righteous conduct. As for those who plot evil , a terrible punishment \nawaits them, and the planning of these will \nfail. \n11. Allah created you from dust, then from a \nsmall drop; then He made you pairs. No fe-\nmale conceives, or delivers, except with His \nknowledge. No living thing advances in years, \nor it s life is shortened, except it be in a Rec-\nord. That is surely easy for Allah.  \n12. The two seas are not the same. One is fresh, \nsweet, good to drink, while the other is salty and bitter. Yet from each you eat tender meat, \nand extract jewelry which you wear.  And you \nsee the ships plowing through them, so that \nyou may seek of His bounty, so that you may give thanks.  \n13. He merges the night into the day, and He \nmerges the day into the night; and He regu-\nlates the sun and the moon, each running for \na stated term.  Such is Allah, your Lord; His is \nthe sovereignty. As for those you call upon \nbesides Him, they do not possess a speck.  \n14. If you pray to them, they cannot hear your \nprayer. And even if they heard, they would not answer you. And on the Day of Resurrec-\ntion, they will reject your partnership. None \ninforms you like an Expert.  \n15. O people! It is you who are the poor, in \nneed of Allah; while Allah is the Rich, the \nPraiseworthy.  \n16. If He wills, He can do away with you, and \nproduce a new creation.  \n17. And that would not be difficult for Allah.  \n18. No burdened soul can carry the burden of \nanother. Even if one weighted down calls for \nhelp with its burden, nothing can be lifted \nfrom it, even if they were related. You are to \nwarn those who fear their Lord inwardly, and \nperform the prayer. He who purifies himself \npurifies himself for his own good. To Allah is \nthe ultimate return.  \n19. Not equal are the blind and the seeing.  \n20. Nor are the darkness and the light.  \n21. Nor are the shade and the torrid heat.  \n22. Nor are equal the living and the dead. Allah \ncauses whomever He wills to hear, but you \ncannot make those in the graves hear.  \n23. You are only a warner.  \n24. We sent you with the truth; a bearer of \ngood news, and a warner. There is no com-\nmunity but a warner has pass ed through it.  \n25. If they disbelieve you, those before them \nalso disbelieved. Their messengers came to \nthem with the clear proofs, with the Psalms, and with the Enlightening Scripture.  \n26. Then I seized those who disbelieved \u2014so \nhow was My rejection?  \n27. Have you not seen that Allah sends down \nwater from the sky? With it We produce \nfruits of various colors.

YA-SEEN   (Ya-Seen)  \n3. You are one of the messengers.  \n4. On a straight path.  \n5. The revelation of the Almighty, the Merci-\nful. \n6. To warn a people whose ancestors were not \nwarned, and so they are unaware.  \n7. The Word was realized against most of \nthem, for they do not believe.  \n8. We placed shackles around their necks, up \nto their chins, so they are stiff -necked.  \n9. And We placed a barrier in front of them, \nand a barrier behind them, and We have en-\nshrouded them, so they cannot see.  \n10. It is the same for them, whether you warn \nthem, or do not warn them \u2014they will not be-\nlieve.  \n11. You warn only  him who follows the Mes-\nsage, and fears the Most Gracious inwardly. \nSo give him good news of forgiveness, and a \ngenerous reward.  \n12. It is We who revive the dead; and We write \ndown what they have forwarded, and their \ntraces. We have tallied all things in a Clear \nRecord.  \n13. And cite for them the parable of the land-\nlords of the town \u2014when the messengers \ncame to it.  \n14. We sent them two messengers, but they de-\nnied them both, so We reinforced them with \na third. They said, \u201cWe are messengers to \nyou.\u201d  \n15. They sa id, \u201cYou are nothing but humans \nlike us, and the Gracious did not send down anything; you are only lying.\u201d  \n16. They said, \u201cOur Lord knows that we are \nmessengers to you.  \n17. And our only duty is clear communica-\ntion.\u201d  \n18. They said, \u201cWe see an evil omen in you; if \nyou do not give up, we will stone you, and a \npainful punishment from us will befall you.\u201d  19. They said, \u201cYour evil omen is upon you. Is \nit because you were reminded? But you are an \nextravagant people.\u201d  \n20. Then a man came running from the remot-\nest part of the city. He said, \u201cO my people, \nfollow the messengers.  \n21. Follow those who ask you of no wage, and \nare themselves guided.  \n22. \u201cAnd why should I not worship Him Who \ncreated me, and to Whom you will be re-\nturned?  \n23. Shall I take other gods instead  of Him? If \nthe Merciful desires harm for me, their inter-\ncession will not avail me at all, nor will they \nsave me.  \n24. In that case, I would be completely lost.  \n25. I have believed in your Lord, so listen to \nme.\u201d  \n26. It was said, \u201cEnter Paradise.\u201d He said,  \u201cIf \nonly my people knew.  \n27. How my Lord has forgiven me, and made \nme one of the honored.\u201d  \n28. After him, We sent down no hosts from \nheaven to his people; nor would We ever send any down.  \n29. It was just one Cry, and they were stilled.  \n30. Alas for the se rvants. No messenger ever \ncame to them, but they ridiculed him.  \n31. Have they not considered how many gen-\nerations We destroyed before them; and that unto them they will not return?  \n32. All of them, every single one of them, will \nbe arraigned before Us.  \n33. And there is a sign for them in the dead \nland: We give it life, and produce from it grains from which they eat.  \n34. And We place in it gardens of palm -trees \nand vines, and cause springs to gush out of it.  \n35. That they may eat from its fruits, although  \ntheir hands did not make it.

Yet they have taken to themselves gods \nother than Allah, that perhaps they may be \nhelped.  \n75. They cannot help them, although they are \narrayed as troops for them.  \n76. So let their words not sadden you. We \nknow what they conceal, and what they re-veal.  \n77. Does the human being not consider that \nWe created him from a seed? Yet he becomes \na fierce adversary.  \n78. And he produces arguments against Us, \nand he forgets his own creation. He says, \u201cWho will revive the bones when they have \ndecayed?\u201d  \n79. Say, \u201cHe who initiated them in the first in-\nstance will revive them. He has knowledge of \nevery creation.\u201d  \n80. He who produced fuel for you from the \ngreen trees, with which you kindle a fire.  \n81. Is not He who created the heavens and the \nearth able to create the like of them? Cer-\ntainly. He is the Supreme All -Knowing Crea-\ntor. \n82. His command, when He wills a thing, is to \nsay to it, \u201cBe,\u201d and it comes to be.  \n83. So glory be to Him in whose hand is the \ndominion of everything, and to Him you will be returned.  \n  \n37. THE ALIGNERS  \n(as-Saffat ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. By the aligners aligning.  2. And the drivers driving.  \n3. And the reciters of the Reminder.  \n4. Your God is indeed One.  \n5. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve-\nrything between them; and Lord of the Easts.  \n6. We have adorned the lower heaven with the \nbeauty of the planets.  \n7. And guarded it against every defiant devil.  \n8. They cannot eavesdrop on the Supernal \nElite, for they get bombarded from every side.  \n9. Repelled \u2014they will have a lingering tor-\nment.  \n10. Except for him who snatches a fragment\u2014\nhe gets pursued by a piercing projectile.  \n11. Inquire of them,  \u201cAre they more difficult to \ncreate, or the others We created?\u201d We created \nthem from sticky clay.  \n12. But you wonder, and they ridicule.  \n13. And when reminded, they pay no atten-\ntion.  \n14. And when they see a sign, they ridicule.  \n15. And they say, \u201cThis is nothing but plain \nmagic.  \n16. When we have died and become dust and \nbones, shall we be resurrected?  \n17. And our ancestors of old?\u201d  \n18. Say, \u201cYes indeed, and you will be totally \nsubdued.\u201d  \n19. It will be a single nudge, and they will be \nstaring.  \n20. They will say, \u201cWoe to us. This is the Day \nof Judgment.\u201d  \n21. \u201cThis is the Day of Separation which you \nused to deny.  \n22. Gather those who did wrong, and their ma-\ntes, and what they used to worship.  \n23. Besides Allah, and lead them to the way to \nHell.  \n24. And stop them . They are to be questioned.\u201d  \n25. What is the matter with you? Why do you \nnot help one another?  \n168", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2932, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba96db3b-6314-4cdb-99fe-26e82e9b9a2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba96db3b-6314-4cdb-99fe-26e82e9b9a2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5c7a9f2-572e-45b5-9bbf-b6fff82c789d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "970d5a81e22382ec67f3725f9262bea84f2c779426e8d6786e707f465d2c7132", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69006a32-d5f6-4914-a0cc-45e564ecca98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "2c5b29bde0c0c3d14120d80a1c79eb85e7474ca9a86a7a8e59be895a53a73f41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ada37ed7-4f69-47d9-9309-f3b4b8516255", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "24b08731bb1fbc86bb41049d724978fd0760f623ee0b841f0de4c857326c6254", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "207c6235917d433c39efb1b8d444aa5cd23342858184c220067828ba77f8bdc5", "text": "37.

And said, \u201cAre we to abandon our gods for \na mad poet?\u201d  \n37. In fact, he came with the truth, and he con-\nfirmed the messengers.  \n38.

As if they were closely guarded pearls.  \n50. Then they will approach one another, \nquestioning.  51. One of them will say, \u201cI used to have a \nfriend.  \n52. Who used to say, \u201cAre you of those who \nbelieve?  \n53. That after we die and become dust and  \nbones, we will be called to account?\u201d  \n54. He will say, \u201cWill you have a look?\u201d  \n55. He will look, and will see him in the pit of \nHell.  \n56. He will say, \u201cBy Allah, you almost ruined \nme. \n57.

None argues against Allah\u2019s revelations ex-\ncept those who disbelieve. So do not be im-\npressed by their activities in the land.  \n5. Before them the people of Noah rejected the \ntruth, as did t he confederates after them. \nEvery community plotted against their mes-\nsenger, to capture him. And they argued with \nfalsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I \nseized them. What a punishment it was!  \n6. Thus the sentence of your Lord became re-\nalized against  those who disbelieve, that they \nare to be inmates of the Fire.  \n7. Those who carry the Throne, and those \naround it, glorify their Lord with praise, and \nbelieve in Him, and ask for forgiveness for \nthose who believe: \u201cOur Lord, You have en-\ncompassed everything in mercy and \nknowledge; so forgive those who repent and follow Your path, and protect them from the \nagony of the Blaze.  8. And admit them, Our Lord, into the Gar-\ndens of Eternity, which You have promised \nthem, and the righteous among their parents, \nand their spouses, and their offspring. You \nare indeed the Almighty, the Most Wise.  \n9. And shield them from the evil deeds. \nWhomever You shield from the evil deeds, \non that Day, You have had mercy on him. \nThat is the supreme achievement.\u201d  \n10. Those who disbelieved will be addressed, \n\u201cThe loathing of Allah is greater than your \nloathing of yourselves \u2014for you were invited \nto the faith, but you refused.\u201d  \n11. They will say, \u201cOur Lord, you made us die \ntwice, and twice you gave us life. Now we \nacknowledge our s ins. Is there any way out?\u201d  \n12. That is because when Allah alone was \ncalled upon, you disbelieved; but when others \nwere associated with Him, you believed. \nJudgment rests with Allah the Sublime, the \nMajestic.  \n13. It is He who shows you His wonders, and \nsend s down sustenance from the sky for you. \nBut none pays heed except the repentant.  \n14. So call upon Allah, with sincere devotion to \nHim, even though the disbelievers resent it.  \n15. Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He \nconveys the Spirit, by His command, upon \nwhomever He wills of His servants, to warn \nof the Day of Encounter.  \n16. The Day when they will emerge, nothing \nabout them will be concealed from Allah. \u201cTo \nwhom does the sovereignty belong today?\u201d \n\u201cTo Allah, the One, the Irresistible.\u201d  \n17. On that Day , every soul will be recom-\npensed for what it had earned. There will be \nno injustice on that Day. Allah is quick to set-\ntle accounts.  \n18. And warn them of the Day of Imminence, \nwhen the hearts are at the throats, choking \nthem. The evildoers will have no intimate \nfriend, and no intercessor to be obeyed.  \n19.

And you attribute equals \nto Him? That is the Lord of the Universe.\u201d  \n10.

So We unleashed upon them a screaming \nwind, for a few miserable days, to make them \ntaste the punishment of shame in this life; but the punishment of the Hereafter is more \nshameful; and they will not be saved.  \n17. And as for Thamood, We guided them, but \nthey preferred blindness over guidance. So the thunderbolt of the humiliating punish-\nment seized them, because of what they used \nto earn . \n18.

Those who do not believe in it seek to has-\nten it; but those who believe are apprehensive \nof it, and they know it to be the  truth. Abso-\nlutely, those who question the Hour are in \ndistant error.  \n19. Allah is kind towards His worshipers. He \nprovides for whomever He wills. He is the \nPowerful, the Honorable.  \n20.

And He answers those who believe and do \ngood deeds, and He increases them of His \ngrace. But the disbelievers will suffer a terri-\nble punishment.  \n27. If Allah were to increase the provision to \nHis servants, they would transgress on earth; but He sends down in precise measure what-\never He wills. Surely, regarding His servants, \nHe is Expert and Ob servant.  \n28. It is He who brings down the rain after they \nhave despaired, and unfolds His mercy. He is \nthe Guardian, the Praised.  \n29.

Yet when one of them is given news of what \nhe attributes to the Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he suppresses grief.  \n18. \u201cSomeone brought up to be beautiful, and \nunable to help in a fight?\u201d  \n19. And they appoint the angels, who are serv-\nants to the Most Gracious, as females. Have \nthey witnessed their creation? Their claim \nwill be recorded, and they will be questioned.  \n20. And they say, \u201cHad the Most Gracious \nwilled, we would not have worshiped them.\u201d \nBut they have no knowledge of that; they are \nmerely guessing.  \n21. Or have We given them a book prior to this \none, to which they a dhere?  \n22. But they say, \u201cWe found our parents on a \ncourse, and we are guided in their footsteps.\u201d  \n23. Likewise, We sent no warner before you to \nany town, but the wealthy among them said, \n\u201cWe found our parents on a course, and we \nare following in their footsteps.\u201d \n24. He would say, \u201cEven if I bring you better \nguidance than what you found your parents following?\u201d They would say, \u201cWe reject what \nyou are sent with.\u201d  \n25. So We wreaked vengeance upon them. Be-\nhold, then, what was the fate of those who \ndeny.  \n26. When Abraham said to his father and his \npeople, \u201cI am innocent of what you worship.  \n27. Except for He who created me, for He will \nguide me.\u201d  \n28. And he made it an enduring word in his \nprogeny, so that they may return.  \n29. I gave these and their forefathe rs some en-\njoyment, until the truth and a manifest mes-\nsenger came to them.  \n30. But when the truth came to them, they \nsaid, \u201cThis is sorcery, and we refuse to believe \nin it.\u201d  \n31. They also said, \u201cIf only this Quran was sent \ndown to a man of importance from t he two \ncities.\u201d  \n32. Is it they who allocate the mercy of your \nLord? It is We who have allocated their live-\nlihood in this life, and We elevated some of \nthem in rank above others, that some of them \nwould take others in service. But your Lord\u2019s \nmercy is better than what they amass.  \n33. Were it not that humanity would become a \nsingle community, We would have provided those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious \nwith roofs of silver to their houses, and stair-\nways by which they ascend.  \n34. And doors to their houses,  and furnishings \non which they recline.  \n35. And decorations. Yet all that is nothing but \nthe stuff of this life. Yet the Hereafter, with your Lord, is for the righteous.  \n36. Whoever shuns the remembrance of the \nMost Gracious, We assign for him a devil, to \nbe his companion.  \n37. They hinder them from the path, though \nthey think they are guided.  \n187", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3379, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "240530f8-2eb8-41b4-90c9-f9ad44982cac": {"__data__": {"id_": "240530f8-2eb8-41b4-90c9-f9ad44982cac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66d1d124-f9f4-40fe-92db-fbcfeced0a5b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "612e628412e7af01c348102674851b1ae7eb7367d8706146185352a3add3dcf1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a43b54b-571b-4083-9b1b-0494055276f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "9b28aeddf53c6b4a3772d6a90b94707a4c29d8aa2766466c6ff5c504cf3cbe2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ed6b53c-cbb1-4a48-9149-5dbe425434a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5cff0610cff50dad8acb0c541c5a2904710033b5211f57e11b24b86efb9b6d23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "72bd081f549e9c04a0cbda2a9612f39bc12e61d66ef392a1786e1026bd6b1477", "text": "43.

It will not benefit you  on that Day, since \nyou did wrong. You are partners in the suf-\nfering.  \n40. Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the \nblind, and him who is in evident error?  \n41.

Ask those of Our messengers We sent be-\nfore you: \u201cDid We appoint gods besides the \nMost Gracious to be worshiped?\u201d  \n46. We sent Moses with Our revelations to \nPharaoh and his dignitaries. He said, \u201cI am \nthe Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.\u201d  \n47. But when he showed them Our signs, they \nstarted laughing at them.  \n48. Each sign We showed them was more mar-\nvelous than its counterpart. And We afflicted \nthem with the plagues, so that they may re-\npent.  \n49. They said, \u201cO sorcerer, pray to your Lord \nfor us, according to His pledge to you, and \nthen we will be guided.\u201d  \n50. But when We lifted the torment from \nthem, they immediately broke their promise.  \n51. Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, \nsaying, \u201cO my people, do I not own the King-\ndom of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath \nme? Do you not see?  \n52. Am I not better than this m iserable wretch, \nwho can barely express himself?  \n53. Why are bracelets of gold not dropped on \nhim, or they angels came with him in proces-sion?\u201d  54. Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed \nhim. They were wicked people.  \n55. And when they provoked Our wrat h, We \ntook retribution from them, and We drowned them all.  \n56. Thus We made them a precedent and an \nexample for the others.  \n57. And when the son of Mary was cited as an \nexample, your people opposed.  \n58. They said, \u201cAre our gods better, or he?\u201d \nThey cited him only for argument. In fact, they are a quarrelsome people.  \n59. He was just a servant whom We blessed, \nand We made him an example for the Chil-dren of Israel.  \n60. Had We willed, We would have made of \nyou angels to be successors on earth.  \n61. He is a porte nt of the Hour, so have no \ndoubt about it, and follow Me. This is a straight way.  \n62. And let not Satan divert you. He is an open \nenemy to you.  \n63. When Jesus came with the clarifications, he \nsaid, \u201cI have come to you with wisdom, and \nto clarify for you so me of what you differ \nabout. So fear Allah, and obey me.  \n64. Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor-\nship Him \u2014this is a straight path.\u201d  \n65. But the factions differed among them-\nselves. So woe to the wrongdoers from the \nsuffering of a painful Day.  \n66. Are they  only waiting for the Hour to come \nupon them suddenly, while they are una-\nware?  \n67. On that Day, friends will be enemies of one \nanother, except for the righteous.  \n68. O My servants, you have nothing to fear on \nthat Day, nor will you grieve.  \n69.

KNEELING   (al-Jathiyah)  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. Ha, Meem.  \n2. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, \nthe Exalted in Might, the Wise.  \n3. In the heavens and the earth are proofs for \nthe believers.  \n4. And in your own creation, and in the crea-\ntures He scattered, are signs for people of \nfirm faith.  \n5. And in the alternation of night and day, and \nin the sustenance Allah sends  down from the \nsky, with which He revives the earth after its \ndeath, and in the circulation of the winds, are \nmarvels for people who reason.  \n6. These are Allah\u2019s Verses which We recite to \nyou in truth. In which message, after Allah \nand His revelations, wil l they believe?  \n7. Woe to every sinful liar.  \n8. Who hears Allah's revelations being recited \nto him, yet he persists arrogantly, as though he did not hear them. Announce to him a \npainful punishment.  \n9. And when he learns something of Our rev-\nelations, he tak es them in mockery. For such \nthere is a shameful punishment.  \n10. Beyond them lies Hell. What they have \nearned will not benefit them at all, nor will \nthose they adopted as lords instead of Allah. \nThey will have a terrible punishment.  \n11. This is guidance. T hose who blaspheme \ntheir Lord\u2019s revelations will have a punish-ment of agonizing pain.  \n12. It is Allah who placed the sea at your ser-\nvice, so that ships may run through it by His \ncommand, and that you may seek of His \nbounty, and that you may give thanks.  \n13. And He placed at your service whatever is \nin the heavens and whatever is on earth \u2014all \nis from Him. In that are signs for a people who think.  \n14. Tell those who believe to forgive those who \ndo not hope for the Days of Allah. He will fully recompense peop le for whatever they \nhave earned.  \n15. Whoever does a good deed, it is for his soul; \nand whoever commits evil, it is against it; then to your Lord you will be returned.  \n16. We gave the Children of Israel the Book, \nand wisdom, and prophecy; and We pro-\nvided t hem with the good things; and We \ngave them advantage over all other people.  \n17. And We gave them precise rulings. They \nfell into dispute only after knowledge came to them, out of mutual rivalry. Your Lord will \njudge between them on the Day of Resurrec-\ntion regarding the things they differed about.  \n18. Then We set you upon a pathway of faith, \nso follow it, and do not follow the inclina-\ntions of those who do not know.  \n19. They will not help you against Allah in any \nway. The wrongdoers are allies of one an-\nother,  while Allah is the Protector of the \nrighteous.  \n20. This is an illumination for mankind, and \nguidance, and mercy for people who believe \nwith certainty.  \n21. Do those who perpetrate the evil deeds as-\nsume that We will regard them as equal to those who believe  and do righteous deeds, \nwhether in their life or their death? Evil is \ntheir judgment!  \n22. Allah created the heavens and the earth \nwith justice, so that every soul will be repaid \nfor what it has earned. And they will not be wronged.  \n23. Have you considered  him who has taken \nhis desire for his god? Allah has knowingly \nled him astray, and has sealed his hearing and \nhis heart, and has placed a veil over his vision. \nWho will guide him after Allah? Will you not \nreflect?  \n24.

Say, \u201cAllah gives you life, then He makes \nyou die; then He gathers you for the Day of \nResurrection, about which there is no doubt. \nBut most people do not know.\u201d  \n27. To Allah belongs the kingship of the heav-\nens and the earth. On the Day w hen the Hour \ntakes place, on that Day the falsifiers will lose.  \n28. You will see every community on its knees; \nevery community will be called to its Book: \u201cToday you are being repaid for what you \nused to do.  \n29. This Book of Ours speaks about you in \ntruth.  We have been transcribing what you \nhave been doing.\u201d  \n30.

But as for those who disbelieved: \u201cWere My \nrevelations not recited to you? But you \nturned arrogant, and were guilty people.\u201d  \n32. And when it was said, \u201cThe promise of Al-\nlah is true, and of the Hour there is no doubt,\u201d \nyou said, \u201cWe do not know what the Hour is; we think it is only speculation; we are not \nconvinced.\u201d  \n33.

MUHAMMAD   (Muhammad)  \nwas their lie, a fabrication of their  own mak-\ning. \n29. Recall when We dispatched towards you a \nnumber of jinn, to listen to the Quran. When \nthey came in its presence, they said, \u201cPay at-\ntention!\u201d Then, when it was concluded, they rushed to their people, warning them.  \n30. They said, \u201cO our peopl e, we have heard a \nScripture, sent down after Moses, confirming \nwhat came before it. It guides to the truth, \nand to a straight path.  \n31. O our people! Answer the caller to Allah, \nand believe in Him; and He will forgive you \nyour sins, and will save you from  a painful \npunishment.\u201d  \n32. He who does not answer the caller to Allah \nwill not escape on earth, and has no protec-\ntors besides Him. Those are in obvious error.  \n33. Do they not realize that Allah, who created \nthe heavens and the earth, and was never \ntired b y creating them, is Able to revive the \ndead? Yes indeed; He is Capable of every-\nthing.  \n34. On the Day when those who disbelieved \nare presented to the Fire: \u201cIs this not real?\u201d They will say, \u201cYes, indeed, by our Lord.\u201d He \nwill say, \u201cThen taste the suffering  for having \ndisbelieved.\u201d  \n35. So be patient, as the messengers with re-\nsolve were patient, and do not be hasty re-\ngarding them. On the Day when they witness \nwhat they are promised, it will seem as if they \nhad lasted only for an hour of a day. A proc-\nlamation:  Will any be destroyed except the \nsinful people?  \n  \n47. MUHAMMAD  \n(Muhammad ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. Those who disbelieve and repel from the \npath of Allah\u2014 He nullifies their works.  \n2. While those who believe, and work right-\neousness, and believe in what was sent down to Muhammad \u2014and it is the truth from their \nLord \u2014He remits their sins, and relieves their \nconcerns.  \n3. That is because those who disbelieve follow \nfalsehoods, while those who believe follow \nthe truth from the ir Lord. Allah thus cites for \nthe people their examples.  \n4. When you encounter those who disbelieve, \nstrike at their necks. Then, when you have routed them, bind them firmly. Then, either \nrelease them by grace, or by ransom, until \nwar lays down its burdens . Had Allah willed, \nHe could have defeated them Himself, but He \nthus tests some of you by means of others. As \nfor those who are killed in the way of Allah, \nHe will not let their deeds go to waste.  \n5. He will guide them, and will improve their \nstate of mind . \n6. And will admit them into Paradise, which \nHe has identified for them.  \n7. O you who believe! If you support Allah, He \nwill support you, and will strengthen your \nfoothold.  \n8. But as for those who disbelieve, for them is \nperdition, and He will waste their  deeds.  \n9. That is because they hated what Allah re-\nvealed, so He nullified their deeds.  \n10. Have they not journeyed through the earth \nand seen the consequences for those before \nthem? Allah poured destruction upon them, and for the unbelievers is something compa-\nrable.  \n11. That is because Allah is the Master of those \nwho believe, while the disbelievers have no \nmaster.  \n12. Allah will admit those who believe and do \ngood deeds into gardens beneath which riv-\ners flow. As for those who disbelieve, they en-joy themse lves, and eat as cattle eat, and the \nFire will be their dwelling.  \n13. How many a town was more powerful than \nyour town which evicted you? We destroyed \nthem, and there was no helper for them.  \n14.

Do those in whose hearts is sickness think \nthat Allah will not expose their malice?  \n30. Had We willed, We could have shown \nthem to you, and you would have recognized \nthem by their marks. Yet you will recognize \nthem by their tone of speech. And Allah \nknows your actions.  \n31. We will certainly test you, until We know \nthose among you who stri ve, and those who \nare steadfast, and We will test your reactions.  \n32.

And other things, of which you were inca-\npable, but Allah has encompassed them. A l-\nlah is Capable of everything.  \n22. If those who disbelieve had fought you, \nthey would have turned back and fled, then \nfound neither protector nor helper.  \n23. It is Allah\u2019s pattern, ongoing since the past. \nYou will never find any change in Allah\u2019s pat-\ntern.  \n24. It is He who withheld their hands from \nyou, and your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca, after giving you advantage over \nthem. Allah is Observer of what you do.  \n25. It is they who disbelieved, and barred you \nfrom the Sacred Mosque, and prevented t he \noffering from reaching its destination. Were \nit not for faithful men and faithful women, \nwhom you did not know, you were about to \nhurt them, and became guilty of an uninten-\ntional crime. Thus Allah admits into His \nmercy whomever He wills. Had they dis-\npersed, We would have punished those who \ndisbelieved among them with a painful pen-\nalty. \n26. Those who disbelieved filled their hearts \nwith rage \u2014the rage of the days of ignorance. \nBut Allah sent His serenity down upon His \nMessenger, and upon the believers, and  im-\nposed on them the words of righteousness \u2014\nof which they were most worthy and deserv-\ning. Allah is aware of everything.  \n27. Allah has fulfilled His Messenger\u2019s vision \nin truth: \u201cYou will enter the Sacred Mosque, \nAllah willing, in security, heads shaven, or  \nhair cut short, not fearing. He knew what you did not know, and has granted besides that an \nimminent victory.\u201d  \n28. It is He who sent His Messenger with the \nguidance and the religion of truth, to make it \nprevail over all religions. Allah suffices as \nWitnes s. \n29. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. \nThose with him are stern against the disbe-\nlievers, yet compassionate amongst them-selves. You see them kneeling, prostrating, \nseeking blessings from Allah and approval. \nTheir marks are on their faces from the ef-\nfects of p rostration. Such is their description \nin the Torah, and their description in the \nGospel: like a plant that sprouts, becomes \nstrong, grows thick, and rests on its stem, im-\npressing the farmers. Through them He en-\nrages the disbelievers. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do good \ndeeds forgiveness and a great reward.  \n  \n49. THE CHAMBERS  \n(al-Hujurat)  \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. O you who believe! Do not place your opin-\nions above that of Allah and His Messenger, \nand fear Al lah. Allah is Hearing and Know-\ning. \n2. O you who believe! Do not raise your voices \nabove the voice of the Prophet, and do not \nspeak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to one another, lest your works be in vain with-\nout you realizing.  \n3. Those who lower their  voices before Allah\u2019s \nMessenger \u2014those are they whose hearts Al-\nlah has tested for piety. They will have for-\ngiveness and a great reward.  \n4. Those who call you from behind the cham-\nbers\u2014most of them do not understand.  \n5. Had they remained patient until you ca me \nout to them, it would have been better for \nthem. But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  \n197", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1544420-b471-48e0-8967-8e65ef26c377": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1544420-b471-48e0-8967-8e65ef26c377", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "91d558d6-a24e-485b-9a95-7da50dc3ef9d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "a80ae5e4f5cb144e2e70f873cbbb915a4261a85a970f647e04c8fc59a09c700a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bd6f759-ae80-4125-a19b-4ec5c7611643", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "9d48377561bcb25e5ec715ba18ffd2d37687fd68e32bc1003aeaac272c032519", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "63ae173d-e1ba-428c-a623-24369bc96d6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ce8b790cdc1b70b165555159f768a38b5d5780dafeaa3110eaf7b6fd2619846", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "167d9284cdef6cfb4597e769cb226911cbf388999d046d56c52f4129136c9f19", "text": "50.

And know that among you is the Messenger \nof Allah. Had he obeyed you in many things, \nyou would have suffered hardship.

Once it has complied, reconcile be-\ntween them with justice, and be equitable. Al-\nlah loves the equitable.  \n10. The believers are brothers, so reconcile be-\ntween your brothers, and remain conscious of Allah, so that you may receive mercy.  \n11. O you who believe! No people shall ridicule \nother people, for they may be better than \nthey. Nor shall any women ridicule other \nwomen, for they may be better than they. Nor \nshall you slander one another, nor shall you \ninsult one another with names. Evil is th e re-\nturn to wickedness after having attained \nfaith.

QAF   (Qaf)  \n8. A lesson and a reminder for every penitent \nworshiper.  \n9. And We brought down from the sky blessed \nwater, and produced with it gardens and \ngrain to harvest.  \n10. And the soaring palm trees, with clustered \ndates.  \n11. As sustenance for the servants. And We re-\nvive thereby a dead town. Likewise is the res-\nurrection.  \n12. Before them the people of Noah denied the \ntruth, and so did the dwellers of Russ, and \nThamood.  \n13. And Aad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of \nLot. \n14. And the Dwellers of the Woods, and the \npeople of Tubba. They all rejected the mes-\nsengers, so My threat came true.  \n15. Were We fatigued by the first creation? But \nthey are  in doubt of a new creation.  \n16. We created the human being, and We \nknow what his soul whispers to him. We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.  \n17. As the two receivers receive, seated to the \nright and to the left.  \n18. Not a word does he utter, but the re is a \nwatcher by him, ready.  \n19. The daze of death has come in truth: \u201cThis \nis what you tried to evade.\u201d  \n20. And the Trumpet is blown: \u201cThis is the \nPromised Day.\u201d  \n21. And every soul will come forward, accom-\npanied by a driver and a witness.  \n22. \u201cYou were in neglect of this, so We lifted \nyour screen from you, and your vision today \nis keen.\u201d  \n23. And His escort will say, \u201cThis is what I have \nready with me.\u201d  \n24. \u201cThrow into Hell every stubborn disbe-\nliever.  \n25. Preventer of good, aggressor, doubter.  \n26. Who fab ricated another god with Allah; \ntoss him into the intense agony.\u201d  27. His escort will say, \u201cOur Lord, I did not \nmake him rebel, but he was far astray.\u201d  \n28. He will say, \u201cDo not feud in My presence \u2014\nI had warned you in advance.  \n29. The decree from Me will no t be changed, \nand I am not unjust to the servants.\u201d  \n30. On the Day when We will say to Hell, \u201cAre \nyou full?\u201d And it will say, \u201cAre there any \nmore?\u201d  \n31. And Paradise will be brought closer to the \npious, not far away.  \n32. \u201cThis is what you were promised \u2014for \nevery careful penitent.  \n33. Who inwardly feared the Most Gracious, \nand came with a repentant heart.  \n34. Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eter-\nnity.\u201d  \n35. Therein they will have whatever they de-\nsire\u2014and We have even more.  \n36. How many generations before them, who \nwere more powerful than they, did We de-\nstroy? They explored the lands \u2014was there \nany escape?  \n37. In that is a reminder for whoever possesses \na heart, or cares to listen and witness.  \n38. We created the heavens and the earth and \nwhat is between them  in six days, and no fa-\ntigue touched Us.  \n39. So endure what they say, and proclaim the \npraises of your Lord before the rising of the \nsun, and before sunset.  \n40. And glorify Him during the night, and at \nthe end of devotions.  \n41. And listen for the Day when the caller calls \nfrom a nearby place.  \n42. The Day when they will hear the Shout in \nall truth. That is the Day of Emergence.  \n43. It is We who control life and death, and to \nUs is the destination.  \n44. The Day when the earth will crack for them \nat once.

And We made the earth bur st with springs, \nand the waters met for a purpose already des-\ntined.  \n13. And We carried him on a craft of planks \nand nails.  \n14. Sailing before Our eyes; a reward for him \nwho was rejected.  15. And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone \nwho would take heed?  \n16. So how were My punishment and My \nwarnings?  \n17. We made the Quran easy to learn. Is there \nanyone who would learn?  \n18. Aad denied the truth. So how were My \npunishment and My warnings? \n19. We unleashed upon them a screaming \nwind, on a day of unrelenting mis ery. \n20. Plucking the people away, as though they \nwere trunks of uprooted palm -trees.  \n21. So how were My punishment and My \nwarnings?  \n22. We made the Quran easy to remember. Is \nthere anyone who would remember?  \n23. Thamood rejected the warnings.  \n24. They said, \u201cAre we to follow one of us, a \nhuman being? We would then go astray, and \nend up in Hell.  \n25. Was the message given to him, out of all of \nus? In fact, he is a wicked liar.\u201d  \n26. They will know tomorrow who the wicked \nliar is.  \n27. We are sending the she -camel as a test for \nthem; so watch them and be patient.  \n28. And inform them that the water is to be \nshared between them; each share of drink \nmade available.  \n29. But they called their friend, and he dared, \nand he slaughtered.  \n30. So how were My punishment and My \nwarnings?  \n31. We sent against them a single Scream, and \nthey became like crushed hay.  \n32. We made the Quran easy to understand. Is \nthere anyone who would understand?  \n33. The people of Lot rejected the warnings.  \n34. We unleashed upon them a shower of  \nstones, except for the family of Lot; We res-cued them at dawn.  \n204", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2817, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b1f2162-0944-4f9d-8389-bb1ca9098523": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b1f2162-0944-4f9d-8389-bb1ca9098523", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ac07159-b113-4b5f-8561-c3daae62a974", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "c341df3bcb6b43a923f01a6647fe4ee9b4aba5f3a6cca8549504a8faa5fc9030", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "388f6597-ac53-4f47-ba01-152eff0f2582", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "215", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "f01e00bfed10ad709faae706a8c819ec214844e739ac2654a2ee92914e03ced5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "76895b13-5688-4f62-8afe-0ade570b7c0b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1957b8094d62533cdfde098105e85603773e7a336ac6ff666da124aadc75d4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "dee4e94f82315dd303016d868033ffb51b68c57df8547f2b4530660bb1240bc8", "text": "55.

It is \nlike a rainfall that produces plants, and de-\nlights the disbelievers. But then it withers, \nand you see it yellowing, and then it becomes \ndebris . While in the Hereafter there is severe \nagony, and forgiveness from Allah, and ac-\nceptance. The life of this world is nothing but \nenjoyment of vanity.  \n21. Race towards forgiveness from your Lord; \nand a Garden as vast as the heavens and the \nearth, prepared for those who believe in Allah \nand His messengers. That is the grace of Al-\nlah; He bestows it on whomever He wills. Al-\nlah is the Possessor of Immense Grace.  \n22. No calamity occurs on earth, or in your \nsouls, but it is in a Book, even before We \nmake it happe n. That is easy for Allah.  \n23. That you may not sorrow over what eludes \nyou, nor exult over what He has given you. Allah does not love the proud snob.  \n24. Those who are stingy, and induce people to \nbe stingy. Whoever turns away \u2014Allah is the \nIndependent, th e Praiseworthy.  \n25. We sent Our messengers with the clear \nproofs, and We sent down with them the \nBook and the Balance, that humanity may \nuphold justice. And We sent down iron, in \nwhich is violent force, and benefits for hu-\nmanity. That Allah may know who su pports \nHim and His messengers invisibly. Allah is \nStrong and Powerful.  \n26. We sent Noah and Abraham, and estab-\nlished in their line Prophethood and the \nScripture. Some of them are guided, but \nmany of them are sinners.  \n27. Then We sent in their wake Our mess en-\ngers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary, \nand We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in \nthe hearts of those who followed him com-passion and mercy. But as for the monasti-\ncism which they invented \u2014We did not or-\ndain it for them \u2014only to seek Allah\u2019s ap-\nprov al. But they did not observe it with its \ndue observance. So We gave those of them \nwho believed their reward, but many of them \nare sinful.  \n28. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and believe \nin His Messenger: He will give you a double \nportion of His mercy, and will give you a light \nby which you walk, and will forgive you. Al-\nlah is Forgiving and Merciful.  \n29. That the People of the Book may know that \nthey have no power whatsoever over Allah\u2019s \ngrace, and that all grace is in Allah\u2019s hand; He gives it to whomever H e wills. Allah is Pos-\nsessor of Great Grace.  \n  \n58. THE ARGUMENT  \n(al-Mujadilah ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. Allah has heard the statement of she who \nargued with you concerning her husband, as \nshe complained to Allah. Allah heard your \nconversation. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.  \n2. Those of you who estrange their wives by \nequating them with their mothers \u2014they are \nnot their mothers. Their mothers are none \nelse but those who gave birth to them. What \nthey say is evil, and a blatant lie. But Allah is \nPardoning and Forgiving.  \n3. Those who estrange their wives by equating \nthem with their mothers, then go back on what they said, must set free a slave before \nthey may touch one another. To this you are \nexhorted, and Allah is well aware of what you \ndo. \n4. But whoever cannot find the means must \nfast for two consecutive months before they \nmay touch one another. And if he is unable, \nthen the feeding of sixty needy people. This, \nin order that you affirm your faith in Allah \nand His Messenger.

Do you not realize that Allah knows every-\nthing in the heavens and everything on earth? \nThere is no secret counsel between three, but \nHe is their fourth; nor between five, but He is \ntheir sixth; nor less than that, nor more, but \nHe is with them wherever they may be. Then, \non the Day of Resurrection, He will inform \nthem of what they did. Allah has knowledge \nof everything.  \n8. Have you noted those who were prohibited \nfrom conspiring secretly, but then reverted to \nwhat they were prohibited from? They con-spire to commit sin, and aggression, and de-\nfiance of the Messenger. And when they \ncome to you, they greet you with a greeting \nthat Allah never greeted you with. And they \nsay within themselves, \u201cWhy does Allah not \npunish us for what we say?\u201d Hell is enough \nfor them. They will roast in it. What a miser-\nable destiny!  \n9. O you who believe! When you conve rse se-\ncretly, do not converse in sin, and aggression, \nand disobedience of the Messenger; but con-\nverse in virtue and piety; And fear Allah, to \nWhom you will be gathered.  \n10. Conspiracies are from Satan, that he may \ndishearten those who believe; but he will not \nharm them in the least, except by leave of Al-\nlah. So let the believers put their trust in Al-\nlah. \n11. O you who believe! When you are told to \nmake room in your gatherings, make room; \nAllah will make room for you. And when you are told to disperse, disperse. Allah elevates \nthose among you who believe, and those given knowledge, many steps. Allah is Aware \nof what you do.  \n12. O you who believe! When you converse \nprivately with the Messenger, offer some-\nthing in charity before your conversation. \nThat is bette r for you, and purer. But if you \ndo not find the means \u2014Allah is Forgiving \nand Merciful.  \n13. Are you reluctant to offer charity before \nyour conversation? If you do not do so, and \nAllah pardons you, then perform the prayer, \nand give alms, and obey Allah and His Mes-\nsenger. Allah is Aware of what you do.  \n14. Have you considered those who befriended \na people with whom Allah has become angry? \nThey are not of you, nor of them. And they \nswear to a lie while they know.  \n15. Allah has prepared for them a terrible pun-\nishment. Evil is what they used to do.  \n16. They took their oaths as a screen, and pre-\nvented others from Allah\u2019s path. They will have a shameful punishment.  \n17. Neither their possessions nor their chil-\ndren will avail them anything against Allah. \nThese are th e inhabitants of the Fire, dwelling \ntherein forever.  \n18. On the Day when Allah will resurrect them \naltogether \u2014they will swear to Him, as they \nswear to you, thinking that they are upon something. Indeed, they themselves are the liars.  \n19. Satan has taken ho ld of them, and so has \ncaused them to forget the remembrance of \nAllah. These are the partisans of Satan. In-\ndeed, it is Satan\u2019s partisans who are the losers.  \n20. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen-\nger are among the lowliest.  \n21. Allah has written: \u201cI will  certainly prevail, I \nand My messengers.\u201d Allah is Strong and \nMighty.  \n22. You will not find a people who believe in \nAllah and the Last Day, loving those who op-pose Allah and His Messenger, even if they \nwere their parents, or their children, or their \nsiblin gs, or their close relatives.

But Allah came at them from where they \nnever expected, and threw terror into their \nhearts.

Had Allah not decreed e xile for them, He \nwould have punished them in this life. But in \nthe Hereafter they will have the punishment \nof the Fire.  \n4.

Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His \nMessenger from them; you spurred neither \nhorse nor camel for them, but Allah gives au-\nthority to His messengers ove r whomever He \nwill. Allah is Able to do all things.  \n7. Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger \nfrom the inhabitants of the villages belongs to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the rela-\ntives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and \nto the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate \nsolely between the wealthy among you. \nWhatever the Messenger gives you, accept it; \nand whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. \nAnd fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish-\nment.  \n8.

They have \nexpelled the Messenger, and you, because you \nbelieved in Allah, your Lord. If y ou have mo-\nbilized to strive for My cause, seeking My ap-\nproval, how can you secretly love them? I \nknow what you conceal and what you reveal. \nWhoever among you does that has strayed \nfrom the right way.  \n2.

Neither your relatives nor your children \nwill benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. \nHe will separate between you. Allah is Ob-servant of what you do.  \n4. You have had an excellent example in Abra-\nham and those with him; when they said to \ntheir people, \u201cWe are quit of you, and what you worship apart from Allah. We denounce \nyou. Enmity and hatred has surfaced between \nus and you, forever, until you belie ve in Allah \nalone.\u201d Except for the words of Abraham to \nhis father, \u201cI will ask forgiveness for you, \nthough I have no power from Allah to do an-\nything for you.\u201d \u201cOur Lord, in You we trust, \nand to You we repent, and to You is the ulti-\nmate resort.  \n5.

There is an excellent example in them for \nyou\u2014for anyone who seeks Allah and the \nLast Day. But whoever turns away \u2014Allah is \nthe Self -Suffici ent, the Most Praised.  \n7. Perhaps Allah will plant affection between \nyou and those of them you consider enemies. Allah is Capable. Allah is Forgiving and Mer-\nciful.  \n8.

FRIDAY   (al-Jumu\u2019ah)  \n14. O you who believe! Be supporters of All ah, \nas Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, \n\u201cWho are my supporters towards Allah?\u201d \nThe disciples said, \u201cWe are Allah's support-\ners.\u201d So a group of the Children of Israel be-\nlieved, while another group disbelieved. We \nsupported those who believed against their \nfoe, so they became dominant.  \n  \n62. FRIDAY \n(al-Jumu\u2019ah ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. Everything in the heavens and the earth glo-\nrifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Al-\nmighty, the Wise.  \n2. It is He who sent among the unlett ered a \nmessenger from themselves; reciting His rev-elations to them, and purifying them, and \nteaching them the Scripture and wisdom; alt-\nhough they were in obvious error before that.  \n3. And others from them, who have not yet \njoined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise.  \n4. That is Allah\u2019s grace, which He grants to \nwhomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of lim-\nitless grace.  \n5. The example of those who were entrusted \nwith the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, \nis like the donkey carrying works of litera-\nture. Miser able is the example of the people \nwho denounce Allah\u2019s revelations. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.  \n6. Say, \u201cO you who follow Judaism; if you \nclaim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclu-\nsion of the rest of mankind, then wish for \ndeath if you a re sincere.\u201d  \n7. But they will not wish for it, ever, due to \nwhat their hands have advanced. Allah knows \nwell the wrongdoers.  \n8. Say, \u201cThe death from which you flee will \ncatch up with you; then you will be returned \nto the Knower of the Invisible and the Vis ible, \nand He will inform you of what you used to \ndo.\u201d 9. O you who believe! When the call is made \nfor prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to \nthe remembrance of Allah, and drop all busi-\nness. That is better for you, if you only knew.  \n10. Then, when the prayer is concluded, dis-\nperse through the land, and seek Allah\u2019s \nbounty, and remember Allah much, so that \nyou may prosper.  \n11. Yet whenever they come across some busi-\nness, or some entertainment, they scramble \ntowards it, and leave you standi ng. Say, \n\u201cWhat is with Allah is better than entertain-\nment and business; and Allah is the Best of \nproviders.\u201d  \n  \n63. THE HYPOCRITES  \n(al-Munafiqun)  \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. When the hypocrites come to you, they say, \n\u201cWe bear witness  that you are Allah\u2019s Mes-\nsenger.\u201d Allah knows that you are His Mes-senger, and Allah bears witness that the hyp-\nocrites are liars.  \n2. They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they \nrepel others from Allah\u2019s path. Evil is what \nthey do.  \n3. That is because they  believed, and then dis-\nbelieved; so their hearts were sealed, and they \ncannot understand.  \n4. When you see them, their appearance im-\npresses you. And when they speak, you listen \nto what they say. They are like propped -up \ntimber. They think every shout is aim ed at \nthem. They are the enemy, so beware of them. \nAllah condemns them; how deluded they are!  \n5. And when it is said to them, \u201cCome, the \nMessenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for \nyou,\u201d they bend their heads, and you see them \nturning away arrogantly.  \n6. It is the same for them, whether you ask for-\ngiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness \nfor them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah \ndoes not guide the sinful people.  \n215", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3430, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fecc35fd-de6c-4a52-b43f-17ceee829cce": {"__data__": {"id_": "fecc35fd-de6c-4a52-b43f-17ceee829cce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "227", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5feb268d-a613-45dc-b3e3-5192a8e17bc0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "227", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "032be6c71c5ea907fefce4eaa3b282a388e16db093ad695e56be79994535c658", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c90fb600-4cf6-41d6-86f2-936ea96a768e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "45e6f762a3b1f4a78cd1000eeaf1e54a87a6ec76576ac32097d3c2f7875974c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca4128dd-b58b-4aad-b3fb-7e454d86beef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5106aa34cefeef3e8ec8221a2cae73d4ef3d1153086581d917f9c3fc48df6a3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "54a2ebef070f9f32315a94db87190c5fb128a00272934d9558c53a4943354ad1", "text": "64.  GATHERING   (at-Taghabun)  \n7.

Everything in the heavens and the earth \npraises Allah. To Him belongs the Kingdom, \nand to Him all praise is due, and He is Able \nto do all things.  \n2. It is He who created you. Some of you are \nunbelievers, and some of you are believers. \nAnd Allah perceives what you do.  \n3. He created the heavens and the earth with \ntruth, and He designed you, and designed \nyou well, and to Him is the final return.  \n4. He knows everything in the heavens and the \nearth, and He knows what you conceal and \nwhat you reveal. And Allah knows what is \nwithin the hearts.  \n5. Has the news not reached you, of those who \ndisbelieved before? They tasted the ill conse-\nquences of their conduct, and a painful tor-\nment awaits them.  6. That is because their messengers came to \nthem with clear explanations, but they said, \n\u201cAre human beings going to guide us?\u201d So \nthey disbelieved and turned away. But Allah \nis in no need. Allah is Independent and \nPraiseworthy.  \n7. Those who disbelieve claim that they will \nnot be resurrected. Say, \u201cYes indeed, by my \nLord, you will be resurrected; then you will be \ninformed of everything you did; and that is \neasy for Allah.\u201d  \n8. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and \nthe Light which We sent d own. Allah is \nAware of everything you do.  \n9. The Day when He gathers you for the Day \nof Gathering \u2014that is the Day of Mutual Ex-\nchange. Whoever believes in Allah and acts \nwith integrity, He will remit his misdeeds, \nand will admit him into gardens beneath \nwhich rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. \nThat is the supreme achievement.  \n10. But as for those who disbelieve and de-\nnounce Our revelations \u2014these are the in-\nmates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever; \nand what a miserable fate!  \n11. No disaster occurs excep t by Allah\u2019s leave. \nWhoever believes in Allah, He guides his \nheart. Allah is Aware of everything.  \n12. So obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But \nif you turn away \u2014it is only incumbent on \nOur Messenger to deliver the clear message.  \n13. Allah, there is no god  but He; and in Allah \nlet the believers put their trust.  \n14. O you who believe! Among your wives and \nyour children are enemies to you, so beware \nof them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and \nforgive \u2014Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.  \n15. Your possessions and your children are a \ntest, but with Allah is a splendid reward.  \n16. So be conscious of Allah as much as you \ncan, and listen, and obey, and give for your \nown good.

The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, \nthe Almighty, the Wise.  \n  \n65. DIVORCE  \n(at-Talaq ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, di-\nvorce them during their period of purity, and \ncalculate their term. And be pious before Al-\nlah, your Lord. And do not evict them from \ntheir homes, nor shall they leave, unless they \nhave committed a proven adultery. These are \nthe limits of Allah \u2014whoever oversteps Al-\nlah\u2019s limits has wronged his own soul. You \nnever know; Allah may afterwards bring \nabout a new situation.  \n2. Once they have reached their term, either \nretain them honorably, or separate from them honorably. And call to wi tness two just \npeople from among you, and give upright tes-timony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever \nbelieves in Allah and the Last Day. And who-\never fears Allah \u2014He will make a way out for \nhim.  \n3. And will provide for him from where he \nnever expected. Wh oever relies on Allah \u2014\nHe will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His \npurpose. Allah has set a measure to all things.  \n4. As for those of your women who have \nreached menopause, if you have any doubts, \ntheir term shall be three months \u2014and also \nfor those who have not menstruated. As for \nthose who are pregnant, their term shall be \nuntil they have delivered. Whoever fears Al-\nlah\u2014He will make things easy for him.  \n5. This is the ordinance of Allah, which He \nsent down to you. Whoever fears Allah\u2014 He \nwill remit his sin s, and will amplify his re-\nward.  \n6. Allow them to reside where you reside, ac-\ncording to your means, and do not harass them in order to make things difficult for \nthem. If they are pregnant, spend on them \nuntil they give birth. And if they nurse your \ninfant, give them their payment. And con-\nduct your relation in amity. But if you disa-gree, then let another woman nurse him.  \n7. The wealthy shall spend according to his \nmeans; and he whose resources are restricted \nshall spend according to what Allah has given \nhim. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what \nHe has given it. Allah will bring ease after \nhardship.  \n8. How many a town defied the command of \nits Lord and His messengers? So We held it \nstrictly accountable, and We punished it with \na dreadful punishment.  \n9. It tas ted the result of its decisions, and the \noutcome of its decisions was perdition.  \n10. Allah has prepared for them a severe retri-\nbution. So beware of Allah, O you who pos-\nsess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent \ndown to you a Reminder.  \n11. A messenger who recites to you Allah\u2019s \nVerses, clear and distinct, that he may bring \nthose who believe and work righteousness \nfrom darkness into light.

Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will \ngive him in exchange wives better than you: \nsubmissive, believing, obedient, penitent, de-\nvout, fasting \u2014previou sly married, or virgins.  \n6. O you who believe! Protect yourselves and \nyour families from a Fire, whose fuel is people \nand stones. Over it are angels, fierce and pow-erful. They never disobey Allah in anything \nHe commands them, and they carry out \nwhatever they are commanded.  \n7. O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses \ntoday. You are being repaid for what you \nused to do.  \n8. O you who believe! Repent to Allah with \nsincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remit your sins, and admit you into gardens \nbeneath which  rivers flow, on the Day when \nAllah will not disappoint the Prophet and \nthose who believed with him. Their light \nstreaming before them, and to their right, \nthey will say, \u201cOur Lord, complete our light for us, and forgive us; You are capable of all \nthings.\u201d  \n9. O prophet! Strive hard against the disbe-\nlievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable \ndestination!  \n10. Allah illustrates an example of those who \ndisbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of \nLot. They were und er two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them. They \navailed them nothing against Allah, and it \nwas said, \u201cEnter the Fire with those who are \nentering.\u201d  \n11. And Allah illustrates an example of those \nwho believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she \nsaid,  \u201cMy Lord, build for me, with you, a \nhouse in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh \nand his works, and save me from the wrong-\ndoing people.\u201d  \n12. And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who \nguarded her womb, and so We breathed into \nher of Our Spirit; and she believed in the \ntruth of her Lord\u2019s Words and His Books, and \nwas one of the devout.  \n  \n67. SOVEREIGNTY  \n(al-Mulk ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. Blessed is He in whose hand is the sover-\neignty, and Who has power over everything.  \n2. He who created death and life \u2014to test \nyou\u2014as to which of you is better in conduct. \nHe is the Almighty, the Forgiving.  \n3. He who created seven heavens in layers. \nYou see no discrepancy in the creation of the \nCompassionate. Look again. Can you see any \ncracks?  \n4. Then look again, and again, and your sight \nwill return to you dazzled and exhausted.  \n5. We have adorned the lower heaven with \nlanterns, and made them missiles against the \ndevils; and We have prepared for them the \npunishment of the Blaze.  \n6. For those who reject thei r Lord, there is the \ntorment of Hell. What an evil destination!  \n7. When they are thrown into it, they will hear \nit roaring, as it seethes.  \n8. It almost bursts with fury. Every time a \nbatch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask \nthem, \u201cHas no warner come t o you?\u201d  \n218", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3522, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3aed85d-d102-4670-b868-a97025cf0aa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3aed85d-d102-4670-b868-a97025cf0aa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88fc01b0-d616-4927-9e8b-956c99e68edd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "f8cdaf8e575a08dbf4ab6561d8eb0de45c378737b4e0781e0810012322a97eb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "65db9da3-540d-4c4e-b4b9-4b4c97ded33a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_path": "/home/tahmid/Desktop/codebase/TaxGpt/content/blogs/quran-english-translation-clearquran-edition-allah.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2433620, "creation_date": "2023-12-25", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-25", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-25"}, "hash": "c07fa3734838bba67a26be4aa3e052312744ffce97e673da0843165df36ea7dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05c778be-a2f2-472f-b678-28fbfdbe7374", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "506744c2f26e8e950390dcafe660f79327fd9dc14a32e51a880c5dbc04b89103", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1541c2176d18971421ec620c00ac1c7146020ba6532adb5e3bcd177cd6be81ad", "text": "68.

Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly \ntwo- thirds of the night, or half of it, or one -\nthird of it, along with a group of those with \nyou. Allah designed the night and the day. He \nknows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what \nis possible for you. He knows that some of \nyou may be ill; and others travelling through \nthe land, seeking Allah\u2019s bounty ; and others \nfighting in Allah\u2019s cause. So read of it what is \npossible for you, and observe the prayers, and give regular charity, and lend Allah a gener-\nous loan. Whatever good you advance for \nyourselves, you will find it with Allah, better \nand generously rewarded. And seek Allah\u2019s \nforgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Mer-\nciful.  \n  \n74. THE ENROBED  \n(al-Muddathir ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. O you Enrobed one.  \n2. Arise and warn.  \n3. And magnify your Lord.  \n4. And purify your clothes.  \n5. And abandon abominations.  \n6. And show no favor seeking gain.  \n7. And be constant for your Lord.  \n8. When the Trumpet is blown.  \n9. That Day will be a difficult day.  \n10. For the disbelievers \u2014not easy.  \n11. Leave Me to him whom I created alone.  \n12. And gave him  vast wealth.  \n13. And children as witnesses.  \n14. And smoothed things for him.  \n15. Then he wants Me to add yet more!  \n16. By no means! He was stubborn towards \nOur revelations.  \n17. I will exhaust him increasingly.  \n18. He thought and analyzed.  \n19. May he perish, how he analyzed.  \n20. Again: may he perish, how he analyzed.  \n21. Then he looked.  \n22. Then he frowned and whined.  \n23. Then he turned back and was proud.  \n24. And said, \u201cThis is nothing but magic from \nthe past.  \n25.

We created man in distress.  \n5. Does he think that no one has power over \nhim?  \n6. He says, \u201cI have used up so much money.\u201d  \n7. Does he think that no one sees him?  \n8. Did We not give him two eyes?  \n9. And a tongue, and two lips?  \n10. And We showed him the two ways?  \n11. But he did not brave the ascent.  \n12. And what will explain to you what the as-\ncent is?  \n13. The freeing of a slave.  14. Or the feeding on a day of hunger.  \n15. An orphan near of kin.  \n16. Or a destitute in the dust.  \n17. Then he becomes of those who believe, and \nadvise one another to patience, and advise \none another to kindness.  \n18. These are the people of happiness.  \n19. But as for those who defy Our revela-\ntions \u2014these are the people of misery.  \n20. Upon them is a padlocked Fire.  \n  \n91. THE SUN  \n(ash-Shams ) \nIn the name of Allah,  \nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \n1. By the sun and its radiance.  \n2. And the moon as it follows it.  \n3. And the day as it reveals it.  \n4. And the night as it conceals it.  \n5. And the sky and He who built it.  \n6. And the earth and He who spread it.  \n7. And the soul and He who proportioned it.  \n8. And inspired it with its wickedness and its \nrighteousness.  \n9. Successful is he who purifies it.  \n10. Failing is he who corrupts it.  \n11. Thamood denied in its pride.  \n12. When it followed its most wicked.  \n13. The messenger of Allah said to them, \u201cThis \nis the she -camel of Allah, so let her drink.\u201d  \n14. But they called him a liar, and hamstrung \nher. So their Lord crushed them for their sin, \nand leveled it.  \n15. And He does not fear its sequel.  \n  \n92.

book of Al-Baqarah and \"Family of Imran\" from the book of Ali 'Imran, several key points are discussed. \n\nFirstly, it is mentioned that Jesus, the son of Mary, was given clear miracles and strengthened with the Holy Spirit. However, despite the clear signs, people still disputed and some believed while others disbelieved. It is emphasized that Allah does whatever He desires.\n\nThe believers are urged to spend from what they have been given before a Day comes where there will be no trading, friendship, or intercession. The disbelievers are referred to as wrongdoers.\n\nAllah is described as the Living and Everlasting, and it is stated that everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him. No one can intercede with Him except with His permission. His knowledge is vast and beyond human comprehension. His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does not burden Him. He is the Most High and the Great.\n\nIt is emphasized that there should be no compulsion in religion and that the right way has become distinct from the wrong way. Whoever renounces evil and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handle.\n\nThe parable of those who spend their wealth in Allah's way is given, comparing it to a grain that produces seven spikes, with each spike containing a hundred grains. Allah multiplies the rewards for those whom He wills. It is advised to spend wealth in the way of Allah without seeking recognition or insulting others. Kind words and forgiveness are considered better than charity followed by insults.\n\nIt is warned not to nullify charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful words. Those who spend their wealth seeking Allah's approval and to strengthen their souls are compared to a garden on a hillside. Their produce is doubled with heavy rain, and even with dew, it is enough. Allah sees everything that people do.\n\nSatan is said to promise poverty and urge immorality, while Allah promises forgiveness and grace. Wisdom is given to those whom Allah wills, and it is stated that whoever is given wisdom has been given much good.\n\nThe believers are urged to fear Allah and forgo usury. If they repent, they may keep their capital without wronging or being wronged. It is advised to defer payment if someone is in hardship, and remitting it as charity is considered better.\n\nThe importance of writing down debts and having witnesses is emphasized. Witnesses should not refuse when called upon, and it is advised not to think it too trivial to write down even small transactions. Concealing testimony is considered a sin.\n\nAllah is described as the owner of everything in the heavens and the earth. Whether something is concealed or disclosed, Allah knows it. It is stated that every soul will find the good and evil it has done presented on the Day of Judgment.

The Quran also mentions the arrival of a messenger to the People of the Book, reminding them that they have received guidance and warning in the past. The verses then shift to the story of Moses and his people, who were instructed to enter the Holy Land but hesitated due to the presence of tyrannical people. Two blessed individuals advised Moses on how to proceed, but some of his people refused to enter and instead asked him to fight on their behalf. Moses prayed for separation from the wicked people and acknowledged that he only had control over himself and his brother. The Quran then provides guidance on various matters, including the importance of seeking Allah's forgiveness, the consequences of disbelief, the punishment for theft, and the importance of following Allah's revelations. It warns against taking the Jews and Christians as allies and emphasizes the need to be cautious of those who mock or oppose the religion. The Quran also mentions the covenant with the Children of Israel and their rejection of messengers, as well as the disbelief of those who deny Allah's oneness. It concludes by reminding believers of their alliance with Allah, His Messenger, and other believers, and warns against befriending those who mock or oppose the religion. The verses also address the issue of intoxicants, gambling, and idolatry, emphasizing their prohibition and the need to avoid them.

It is mentioned that even if miracles were to occur, many people still would not believe. The hearts and visions of those who refuse to believe are turned away, and they are left to their rebellion. It is stated that even if angels were sent down and the dead spoke to them, they still would not believe unless Allah wills it. It is explained that every prophet is assigned an enemy, human and jinn devils, who deceive and inspire each other. The hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter are inclined to it. \n\nIn the chapter titled \"The Elevations\" (al-A'raf), it is mentioned that those who believe and do righteous deeds will have a Home of Peace with their Lord. On the Day of gathering, the jinn will be told that they have exploited humans, and the humans will say that they have profited from each other. It is stated that messengers were sent to warn them, but they were seduced by the life of the world and testified against themselves as disbelievers. It is explained that towns are not destroyed for injustice while their inhabitants are unaware, and that everyone has ranks according to their deeds. Allah is described as the Rich Beyond Need and the Possessor of Mercy. \n\nIn the chapter titled \"The Elevations\" (al-A'raf), it is mentioned that nothing is forbidden to a consumer except carrion, spilled blood, the flesh of swine, and a sinful offering dedicated to other than Allah. It is stated that the Jews were forbidden from consuming certain things, and they were penalized for their inequity. The polytheists claim that if Allah had willed, they would not have practiced idolatry, but they are reminded that those before them also lied until they tasted Allah's might. It is mentioned that the scripture revealed is a blessed one, and those who follow it and are righteous will receive mercy. \n\nIn the chapter titled \"The Elevations\" (al-A'raf), it is stated that those who divided their religion into sects have their case with Allah. It is explained that good deeds will be rewarded and evil deeds will be repaid. The prayer and worship of the believers are devoted to Allah, and they are commanded to be the first to submit. It is mentioned that no soul gets except what it is due, and no soul bears the burdens of another. It is stated that Allah is the Lord of all things and the creator of the heavens and the earth. The night overtakes the day, and the sun, moon, and stars are subservient to Allah's command.

The story of Shuaib, who advised his people to worship Allah and be just, is also mentioned. On page 69, the passage continues with the mention of the people who inherited the land after its inhabitants and how they rejected the messengers and their signs. The story of Moses and Pharaoh is also mentioned, including the miracles Moses performed to prove his message. The people of Pharaoh faced various plagues as a consequence of their disbelief. On page 70, it is mentioned that the people of Pharaoh faced barren years and shortage of crops as a punishment. They attributed their misfortune to Moses and rejected his message. The passage also mentions the story of the people who worshipped a golden calf and how Moses reacted to their actions. On page 71, it is mentioned that some of the people of Moses violated the Sabbath and were tested by Allah. The passage also mentions the punishment inflicted upon them for their disobedience.

The Quran warns against leaving homes boastfully and showing off before others, as Allah comprehends their actions. Satan can deceive people and make their deeds appear good, but when faced with a real challenge, he turns away. The hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts claim that the religion of the believers has deluded them, but Allah is mighty and wise. In the chapter titled \"Repentance\" (at-Tawbah), it is mentioned that Allah lightens the burden of the believers and supports them. It is not for a prophet to take prisoners before subduing the land, as Allah desires the Hereafter. Believers are advised to consume what they have gained legitimately and remain conscious of Allah. If Allah finds good in the hearts of prisoners, He will give them better and forgive them. However, if they intend to betray, they have already betrayed Allah. Those who believe, emigrate, struggle in Allah's cause, and provide shelter and support are allies of one another. The Quran also mentions the actions of the disbelievers, hypocrites, and those who trade away Allah's revelations for a cheap price. It advises believers to fight those who do not believe in Allah, the Last Day, and the religion of truth until they pay the due tax. The Quran condemns those who claim that Ezra or the Messiah is the son of Allah and take their rabbis and priests as lords instead of Allah. It states that Allah will make His guidance and religion prevail over all religions, even though the idolaters dislike it. The Quran encourages believers to fight in the cause of Allah and promises punishment for the disbelievers.

Those who do not hope to meet Allah and are content with worldly life will dwell in the Fire, while those who believe and do good deeds will be guided by their Lord and will experience bliss in the Gardens of Bliss. Adversity leads people to pray to Allah, but once their troubles are relieved, they forget about their prayers. The deeds of the transgressors appear good to them.\n\nIn the verses from the chapter \"Hud\", it is mentioned that Allah transports people across land and sea, and when they are in danger, they pray to Allah for salvation. However, once they are saved, they commit violations and oppose justice. The present life is compared to water that is absorbed by the plants of the earth, but then the earth is turned into stubble. Allah invites people to the Home of Peace and guides them to the straight path. Those who have done good will have goodness and more, while those who have earned evil deeds will be rewarded with similar evil. On the Day of Judgment, people will be gathered together and their partners in disbelief will disown them. Every community has a messenger, and judgment will be passed between them with fairness. Those who deny the meeting with Allah will be the losers. Noah, Moses, and Aaron are mentioned as messengers sent to their people with clear proofs, but they were rejected by those who acted arrogantly and opposed justice. The Children of Israel were settled in a position of honor, but they differed when knowledge came to them. The truth has come from Allah, and those who deny His revelations will be among the losers. The passage also mentions that Allah is the sustainer of all creatures on earth and that He created the heavens and the earth in six days to test people's conduct.

Moses expresses his fear and asks for his brother Aaron to accompany him. God assures Moses that his arm will be strengthened and he will be given authority. However, when Moses presents the signs to the people, they accuse him of using fabricated magic. Moses affirms that God is aware of those who bring guidance and those who will have a negative outcome. Pharaoh declares himself as the only god and orders the construction of a tower to reach the God of Moses. Pharaoh and his troops act arrogantly and believe they will not be returned to God. As a punishment, God seizes Pharaoh and his troops and throws them into the sea. Moses is given the scripture as guidance for mankind. The Quran emphasizes that the material possessions of this world are temporary and that the true life is in the Hereafter. Those who reject the messengers and invoke other gods will not be saved. Abraham advises his people to worship Allah and seek their livelihood from Him. The Quran mentions the punishment of previous communities and compares those who take protectors other than Allah to spiders building fragile houses. Allah is praised for His creation of the heavens and the earth, the diversity of languages and colors, and the signs He shows, such as lightning and water from the sky. The Quran encourages believers to reflect on these signs and not to argue with the People of the Scripture except in the best manner.

Believers who do righteous deeds will have the Gardens of Shelter, while transgressors will face the Fire. Those who turn away from Allah's revelations will face vengeance. Moses was given the Book as guidance for the Children of Israel. Allah will judge between people on the Day of Resurrection. The Hour (Day of Judgment) is known only to Allah. Disbelievers are cursed, and Allah has prepared a Blaze for them. Believers should not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission.

Allah knows what is in people's hearts.\n\nIn the chapter \"Sheba,\" it is mentioned that everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. Disbelievers may deny the Hour, but it will come upon them. Allah punished the people of Sheba for their ingratitude. Satan led people astray, but Allah is the Guardian over all things.
